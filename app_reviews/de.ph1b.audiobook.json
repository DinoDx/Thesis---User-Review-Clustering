For a free and open Media Player it is spectacular. Don't let the audiobook part of the title throw you off. It plays just about everything audio wise. Have not tried it for video so I don't know if it plays that. So what I got it for was for my audio books and the podcast and frankly anything that was longer in length then a song. I was tired of the stock Android players that would lose my place in a podcast or a book etc when I would pause for too long or got a phone call or any general destruction that you will get using a phone. The only thing keeping it from a perfect score is if they instituted A podcast locating and downloading service."}

This app completely reverses that by adding all the touches specific to audiobook playback that you may not even have thought of.  Most importantly, it allows you to easily seek backward or forward by a configurable number of seconds right from the lock screen. Even better, you can use long press on the volume button to achieve the same thing without turning the screen on at all! No more having to enter your pin, open Google Music, and futz around trying to touch the correct point on the seek bar because you missed an essential passage in your audiobook.  There is *very* fast response to user requests and bug reports in spite of the fact that it is free of charge, and has no ads. Furthermore, being open source, installing it on your phone doesn't give you that dirty feeling or suspicion that your data is being stolen.  Given that a lot of crappier apps charge, harass,  and/or spy on you, you should really consider donating if you find this app useful."}
