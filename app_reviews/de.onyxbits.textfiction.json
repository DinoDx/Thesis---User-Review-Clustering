It directs new users to some beginner (tutorial) stories, and makes it easy to find games that interest you. The only things I'd like to see changed are listing the score and day/time (in game) on the main screen while playing (as this is important in some games), and correcting the issue of double enters with just one \"enter\" press when using a bluetooth keyboard. I found a temporary fix for the latter issue by selecting the \"auto collapse keyboard\" option under settings, but this makes it so I have to manually select the text entry field every time before typing - annoying, but better than the program interpreting one press of the enter button as two. Still, a great program with lots of potential. Thanks!"}
