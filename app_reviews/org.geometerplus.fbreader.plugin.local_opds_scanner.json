I've upgraded to Premium, and now I'm encountering features that I'm unsure whether I need them or not. I don't know what Calibre is, or DjVu. I just want to read books with no fuss, preferably offline. I could do that better with FBR free. Still love the main App, though."}

Google play or Android market has everything however its not the best navigation system in the world. What slows the adding of plugins is all the icons are the same... knowing your not interested in 1 plugin with everything (and I agree, why install if never used), you make a numbered list. 0 is the FBReader main .exe .apk and 01 thru whatever have a static number that never changes & you make new icons that include said number (by script=easy). Also every new app added will update all your older app descriptions. This would make it faster for new installation and upgrades.... I have not run this android version yet, limited time right now, 5 star early! I miss the right mouse button on phones/tablets, copy, cut, paste... screen shots, full or sections, extract all images, text, urls, author info, etc... bookmarks, last viewed files, unlimited history... highlighting text with different colors, searchable by color & keyword.. sidenotes.
