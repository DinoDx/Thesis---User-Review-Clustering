I did a fresh setup, and it says you're supposed to boot the bios first before loading a game, but even that makes it crash.

I originally thought the 2K game roms were the problem. But I am seeing a pattern here. The only games I have wanted to play that will not run are the Dreamcast games that run on Windows CE. Is there any possible way to fix this in a future update?"}

I finally got it working when I saw it saying that my MOGA pivot app crashed after I launched the emulator and it hung. It used to work with it installed no problem until the lasted update to reicast, but I guess the older version of android wasn't showing the error about moga pivot. This Moga pivot is what i use to play with a game MOGA game controller. I have not tried re-installing MOGA pivot yet so when I do, I will update this again if it still works after installing it back on the phone. The controller is what made it fun, I really hate touch screen for games that were designed for a controller"}

And shenmue 1 disk 1 worked fine, but then the game could not find my save, even though it was still on the memory card when I booted the bios. Also, Sonic Adventure 1 has widescreen issues on the nexus 2012, i don't know about other games. The cdi format seems to work fine, i don't know why you discourage it. It is super simple to setup, I was able to figure it out without even looking it up. That's all I found so far using a Google nexus 7 2012.

There are 2 things that stop me from giving it that extra star, and it's only because I'm spoilt from ePSxe.  1. Exiting the app via the Home button quits the game without warning. Every once in awhile I'll accidentally hit it (or hit it on purpose, forgetting it doesn't work the same way ePSxe does), losing a ton of progress. (In case anyone doesn't know how ePSxe works, it remembers the state the game was in after you leave the app, allowing you to restore the game the next time you come back.)  2. Save states. This is mainly only a problem because of the first one. With ePSxe I had 3 options if I wanted to take a break or do something else quickly on my phone. Find a save point (not as easy in most games), save states or close the game and restore it later, keeping my progress. With Reicast my only option is to find a save point, which are scarce. Unlike the actual consoles these emulators emulate, there's usually countless times you have to urgently close the app due to phone calls or text messages.  It's still a really great app and definitely worth getting, though."}

The problems arise when the app is made inactive by going to the home screen or locking the Device. Doing so stops emulation.

Controller input is spot on and even includes analog support for sticks and triggers. With more work this emulator could be close to perfect."}

I highly recommend looking up how best to name the folders and dc_bios.bin and dc_flash.bin and follow the instructions completely. It'll make things go much more smoothly. I'd also recommend putting your ROMs in the same folder as these. This makes setting your paths that much easier. With that said, on with the review. I've really only played Shenmue at any length so far, though I have briefly tried a few other games to test out how well they work. Shenmue works great for the most part. There are some graphical glitches that come up frequently, like this weir, creepy thing that happens with Ryo's eyes. Besides that, the game runs smoothly. Framerate is consistent and never drops, load times are as good as they were on Dreamcast and everything seems to work fine so far.  The only complaint I would make is with the games that don't work. I wasn't able to run several of them so far. SKies of Arcadia, Omikron, Time Stalkers and Stupid Invaders so far. This is to be expected with a work in progress. All things considered, I am very impressed with this and look forward to improvements down the road. Keep up the good work!"}

One thing to note, and I know this is alpha but I thought it was weird - on the One M8, all videos played fine and the \"widescreen mode\" displayed the extra geometry (just like on nullDC), but on the Ouya, videos only show as 4 faint \"polygons\" and widescreen mode does not show the extra geometry.  Having said that, this is simply amazing to have a Dreamcast emulator running this well on Android, especially on a Tegra 3 Ouya. Looking forward to updates."}

The emulator is very picky about the bios you use, but finding the right one isn't too hard. However, one simple fix for the app would be having the app scan for the bios, fixing the biggest issues people have. I also think a VMU emulator widget on your lock screen would be a great feature. Performance wise this emulator is one of the bests, performing better than both the N64 and PSX emulators avaliable, really showing the real power of Android."}

The other tested game, Sonic Adventure 2, played at a ferocious frame rate and emulated perfectly, aside of a few flickering textures that were nowhere near bothersome. Only thing that bothered me was the odd response of the on screen analog stick, which I got used to enough to fool around with the game. Still great to see the often overlooked DC playing on Android and looking good."}

I was WRONG, it actually runs smooth, with sound, and controls great on the Nvidia Shield.  Even the analog stick works as an analog,  the triggers work, and the button layout happens to be the same as a Dreamcast controller.  When this gets further this emu will make the Nvidia Shield basically a portable Dreamcast.  The Shield seems the ideal device for this with the control layout and speed and they are pretty cheap now.  The only negative is the icons, I can't tell what the hell they do, the symbols are not very obvious , I just start hitting things until something happens, took a star off for that. Maybe make the icons user replaceable, I will do my own art that makes sense for me.  The other thing is depth fog is not implemented giving some odd graphics at times.  Great work otherwise though!"}

But there is a way out if your lucky you can spindash out and the game will play as normal. I am surprised at how good this emulator runs on the weak android devices so well and mostly how great this emulator runs for an alpha. I Cant wait to see how this emulator will improve over the next couple of months. Kudos to whoever made this ^_^"}

The games also need an Auto Frameskip option. Shenmue still has some graphics issues, like no eyelids for the main character, and the more difficult half pages in your notebook. More important is that Shenmue uses the D-Pad to move, and this emulator doesn't have diagonals on the D-Pad yet. So, I can barely move around. Play it yourself for 30 minutes. Good, but not really playable yet. Though, I am really trying to make the best til then."}

It is to be expected that it still requires a lot of polish and bug fixes.  That being said, this is a fantastic and very promising emulator thus far.  Just in the last few updates, we've seen some dramatic improvements to performance and user interface.  It takes a powerful device to run properly though.  Even an Nvidia Shield can chug at times.   Issues I've encountered: -Gamepad mapping isn't consistent -UI, while improved, is still a bit unintuitive.  Icons are too vague. -Mild graphical glitches that make some polygons seep through one another   Looking forward to seeing what the future holds for Reicast and in the meantime, enjoying some DC classics!"}

Being an alpha release I understand there is a lot to work on.  Shenmue is missing a lot of textures and crashes, but Grandia II runs very well.    My suggestion is to fix the issue with reicast completely closing itself if a pop up text message or phone goes to sleep by not touching the screen.  You lose a lot of progress because of that bug.  Good job though.  I love playing Grandia II on the go.  Going to try another favorite Skies of Arcadia next."}

Keep in mind, that the Buttons are kind of hard to get a bearing on at first. R1 is the Start Button. L and R2 are the L/R Shoulders, but the A, B, X and Y buttons are what they would be on the actual DC. Some Games work with both the Digital and Analog Joysticks depending on what kind of Controller you have. Shield works with both, but Moga Hero only works with the Analog. Games that run perfectly with minor Graphics=== CapVSNK 1 and 2, NFL Blitz 2k and 2k1, and Marvel VS Capcom 2. Most of the Games I ran are in GDI Format. Hydro Thunder works in CDI Format if you can keep up with it. LOL. Runs VERY fast. MK Gold runs, but there are no Analog/Digital Control. Also, for some reason there is no way to run CDX/GameShark, Action Replay, Ect. mainly because they will not load and also no way to change the Disks."}

I can finally feel like I have dreamcast in my hands again. The only and only problem I have with this emulator is the fact that there is no configuration options yet. I don't mind that some games don't run well yet, that's apart of emulation and working on a project, I know one day you will get this emulator to where it needs to be. When I use my xbox controller on my note 3 any game that only uses the D pad means I can't play it with the controller because there are no button mappings to change and my controller doesn't recognize D pad controls, other than that excellent job on the emulator and I hope for an update soon."}

Of course the developer cannot tell you where to get ROMs or the BIOS files. It's a simple web search. Pros- Easy learning curve and easy to use, very playable content. Cons.  Thumb stick sensor is twitchy, some graphics in some games are a little glitchy, but overall this emulator, being in it's early stages, is about perfect. Need some options to tweak performance soon here, but, NILLWARE, please do not change the GUI! Focus on the bugs.

Been wanting to play Dreamcast games handheld for a while now! Its a little bit rusty but thats to be expected from a DC emulator in its alpha stage. Some minor problems at the moment. The lack of a good user interface makes the emulator look worse than it actualy is. The screen automaticaly goes into stand by, can easily change in your phones settings. When I switch apps I cant go directly back into the game and have to load again. It would be nice to change the aspect ratio. Brilliant app!"}

My JXD S7800B tablet has Start/Select buttons and it's own L1/L2 + R1/R2. Would love to assign Start to my actual Start button.

Sonic Adventure one seems to be basically flawless except for : - Video Cutscenes jitter a little (not much of a problem, who cares really?) -Writing in character selection menu disappears but shows up when the screen fades -Sonic's eyes have a little glitching sometimes. Flawless emulation other than that! No slowdown or choppy music! :)  Sonic Adventure 2 on the other hand runs full speed, but the gameplay keeps glitching up intensely when there seems to be too many polygons on screen. Still playable though, no slowdown or choppy music either. :)  Amazing emulator for alpha stage, buttons should be configurable (start button is configured to Left shoulder button and start button on my system sends me back to home screen, ugh), full screen support and save state support, fix what makes the small graphical glitches and it is basically perfect for me! Keep the good work!:)"}

Was following development on NullDCe (drkRaziel) but since the apk leak there has not been much news on that front.   I have installed this and dumped the bios and flash bin files but can not get the application to find the files that are put on the sdcard in the path mentioned by the developer. Think the issue is that my sdcard is actually called extSdCard? so the path is wrong in the eyes of the app?  I am testing the app on a samsung galaxy s3. I am giving the app 5 stars because i am supporting the developer and am sure the app works fine on other phones. So much looking forward to updates and seeing where this progresses! Want to play the best games ever on this emulator! Shenmue and Shenmue 2!!!!  Everyone please support this developer we need to thing to progress!   Thank you so much developer.   Asam  Update: Just realised that this is by drkRaziel!!! You legend!!! Thank you so much for keeping this going!!! I know this things gonna get better!  Update: Worked it out, basically silly samsung file explorer, you need to use EZ File Explorer and you can then see the sdcard mount point folder. Its now booting into the app so will play with it and update!!!"}
