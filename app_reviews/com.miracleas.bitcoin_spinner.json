It is decentralized, easy to install, open source, reliable, and has all the essential tools you need, including QR Code scanning and backup export.  It doesn't try to download the blockchain, which is essential for saving storage space, and sends and receives transactions quickly.  However, there are two things I would like to see in future versions: the ability to sign off-line transactions and the ability to create new addresses.  Most other clients let you make as many address as you want, and show you the combined balance of all of them.  Furthermore, sometimes, you're not connected to the internet, and you want to send a transaction, and offline signing would enable that.  Despite missing those two features, Bitcoin Spinner is still better than all other mobile apps out there hands down."}

I would make one recommendation for improvement to the Transaction History screen.  For incoming transactions (ie deposits) miners in pools will see every other address that the block of coins was paid to as well as their own address in the \"Sent To:\" column.  This can amount to thousands of other addresses which is really worthless information to the wallet account holder.   It would make sense to filter out all the other addresses and collapse them down to a \"more...\" button or something so the transaction list does not become so long and bloated with needless detail.  In my case, I have to scroll down many pages to see the next deposit information for each mining payout.  This has made the Transaction History load very slow and become almost unusable."}
