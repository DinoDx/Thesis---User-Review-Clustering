However, I can't find the \"Desktop Client\" mentioned in the decription above. It's not on your website. For a desktop client I use Pidgin at the moment, and unfortately pictures sent with this app don't show in pidgin.  This is the only downside of the app (and I don't know if the problem is with this app or with Pidgin). Please direct me to your aforementioned desktop app and I will add a star to my rating :-)"}

Unfortunately I have a good deal of trouble connecting to my own XMPP servers through this app, and I don't really have a lot of options at my disposal to try and fix that in this app. I would love to eventually see something like Xabber's \"Custom Host\" menu (which allows one to specify the server IP/FQDN and port without a SRV record or if/when it needs to be overridden, e.g. when you're behind the server's own router), though admittedly my own situation might be a bit niche. Other than this and the issue with GTalk messages constantly failing, this app is off to a fantastic start, and I look forwarding to playing with it more as it progresses."}

I've been beta-testing this app for a while, and it is the first XMPP client that I've actually found myself using quite a bit. It's built with a clean design and is packed with obscure-but-useful features.  I especially appreciate the nice balance of customizability and simplicity, where other clients tend to err on the side of too many options. This results in a really streamlined, well thought-out user experience. One can tell that a great deal of attention is payed to UX design. Another thing that makes this client really stick out is the support for various XEPs, which really, noticably improve mobility performance.   Keep in mind that this is a somewhat early version of the app, so occasionally, I still run into bugs, but these are usually fixed very quickly by the developer."}
