Everytime I add a new contact in the phone, the name will always become empty.  After I sync the database, I access the addressbook via my PC and I can see the new entry. It only has the phone number.  I'm not sure is this, lollipop's fault or davdroid's fault. UPDATE #2: More weird things. Some contacts are missing in the phone, but it is available in the baikal database. I verified it by installing CardDAV-Sync free beta by Marten Gajda  and I can find the contact after that. Really weird. I really hope that I don't have to buy another apps after I have purchased this."}
