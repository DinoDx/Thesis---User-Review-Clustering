Not all the photos I took were saved as image notes, most of the ones that were saved as image notes, were not saved in my gallery on my phone to download separately. And the geotagging on the photos only worked for about 5 percent of the images. The rest got pinned to the beginning of the track. With these issues, this app is simply not useable for me. (used on a Moto X 2013 running Android 4.4.4)"}
