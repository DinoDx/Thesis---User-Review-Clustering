In order to adjust an antennae using this app you would have to have a pencil and paper to write down all of the station number translations during the 15+ minutes it takes to manually \"scan\" each individual station.  Then manually type in the stations you want to tune/adjust in a tedious process of turn, type, wait, repeat.  The alternative is to \"scan\" them several times to make sure getting one station clear doesn't undo the tuning of another. This, of course, would take several hours if you live anywhere near a metropolitan area.  There are 2 or 3 extremely simple UI enhancements that could make this \"simple\" app actually usable. Since this hasn't happened in the last year, I don't expect it anytime soon. For the love of all that's usable, couldn't you at least retain the list of tuned stations to scroll through?!  From my experience with app development, I can only imagine that the original app was written in less than an hour and the only development time devoted to it since has been debugging."}

This App is a must when determining the best place to position your Dual's HD antenna, and/or even when validating the quality of your in wall coax runs, splitters, loss and checking for end point SNR with either the Dual or Prime with CC!!  The only way to make this any better would be to have an automated select channel 'sweep' loop that you could setup to identify 2 or 3 channels to cycle between when you posistion the Antenna in order to determine a best physical averaging position for placement considering your favorite channels. This would help those of us trying to locate that perfect sweet spot with HD stations located in all directions (city) vs mainly located in one direction (suburbs and outskirts) when tuning for  signal averaging vs peaking."}
