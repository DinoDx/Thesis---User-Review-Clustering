Very fast for recording GPS location for small house numbers. Slower for house numbers that are longer.  It's not perfect - the menu access that work in every other Android app (like the hard \"menu\" button) don't bring up the menu in this app. It could do with a few more niceties like direct upload to Open StreetMap.  Overall, pretty gopd."}

It might be useful to have auto increment for numbers.  In the UK we generally have odd numbers on one side and even on the other.  To map both sides as you walk down a street I suspect you would need an entry box for left and right with independent auto increment of 2 for each as it doesn't follow that 2 is opposite to 1 etc.    Another option might be to have a button that just adds 2 to the last entry.  This would be useful in some situations and would save on key presses as soon as you get into double digits.  Many thanks for the app."}
