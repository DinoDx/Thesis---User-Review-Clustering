The Android client works very well, but if the data store is located on a slow connection or a slow hard drive, the Android client will time out from time to time when refreshing a folder.  I would like to see some more features included in the Android client, such as tighter integration with other apps, ability to copy or move files to other folders within Seafile, and an option to download files to other locations on my Android. Currently, files are downloaded to the Seafile folder by default.  All in all, a great program."}

(Update)  I did find the cause, when the phone would auto-fill my email address. it puts a space after the email that obviously doesn't show.. Seafile does not accept this what so ever.

You can use free or paid space at seacloud.cc or set up your own server on your own hardware or pay someone to do that for you. I am using the client with a Seafile-server I installed on a computer (a cheap and energy saving raspberry pi) in my local network at home. Setting the server up was surprisingly easy and it runs good on the slow pi. The Android-Seafile-client works fine and is definitely well done. But I can\u2019t choose the location of the folder corresponding to a library and it does not synchronize automatically complete folders (and sub-folders) as the Ubuntu-Linux-client does. That is a major issue for me. Besides that, I like the client and the server. Very good job!"}
