It's simple and intuitive but gets the job done!  It's not fancy-looking but the ones that are over complicate things and cause me not to use them.  This one's a keeper."}

(I tried about 12 different ones) This one has an ultra simple, easy to use interface, that sets it apart from the rest.  I use this app more than any other on my phone.  If you are a Dave Ramsey follower and want digital envelopes, this is your app.  The developer is awesome at responding as well.  Quit reading, download now! :-)"}

I'd give it 5 stars but looking for one key feature, the ability for all or individual envelopes to reset weekly (or monthly, biweekly, etc.) to a user-defined amount."}

It helps me keep expenses under control already.   Please add some way to split new paychecks into envelopes without typing. Something using sliders.   Oh and we don't need a button to create new envelopes. I think transfers between envelopes are more used so put an icon for that and put the  new envelope button into the menu."}
