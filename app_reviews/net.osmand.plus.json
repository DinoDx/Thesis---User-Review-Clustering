It is fairly easy to come to grips with.  Menu items are not buried too deeply.  In several hours of trying things out I did not crash it, and my Aldi tablet is fairly humble in the specs dept.   It allows you to set things up the way you prefer.  It has no issues with the external SD card. You can navigate bush tracks, great for hiking or biking. It is easy to save favourites, plot courses, change settings etc.  It feels as though a lot of thought and work has gone into making it usable."}

Apparently this is done through openstreemap dot org and is a more complicated process than it sounds. So for this I still use WAZE when in the car and OSMand+ for cycling or motorcycling where reception can be shotty."}

Just download maps, points of interest, wikipedia articles etc at home on your phone - and when you are travelling, you will have everything in your pocket you need (where's the next pharmacy, when was this church built, where is the next metro station) - all without having to go online.  -Is has a very fair business model (you get everything for free! You get all features, plus 10 maps for free. And you can always make your own maps using open data - you ONLY pay for the convenience of getting unlimited global pre-compiled maps, and for the good feeling of supporting the developers - and they continually improve the program)  -They keep adding great features: ability to edit/correct OSM map data, to track your location and share with others, to save your parking spot, altitude lines, hillshade, ... ..."}

It works very well for that, but I find the interface clunky and hard to recommend to users like my parents. One very nice thing is the data this has. It's user driven I believe, so likely will be hit or miss, but my university has detail down to where phones are on campus and sidewalk paths. Nice touch. 3.5 stars really, but rounding up since the offline maps and self tracking features are nice, and worth purchasing to support them."}

The intention is that both installations are set up in exactly the same way so updates will be common to both, they are not.  I'm having to download files several times before they are recognised as being updated and one phone now shows about a dozen files as requiring being updated when in fact the latest versions are installed. The S3 freezes at least once during every update session - probably due to the lack of free memory.  It seems the developers have run out of ideas on how the app can be improved. They have made updating too complicated despite recent changes to make it simpler. This app doesn't need to be improved but bugs need to be fixed.  I'll be removing this app from both phones shortly. There are simpler apps that do what I need. I don't need an app that tries to do everything but then fails by telling me that I have updates to install when I don't as it's costing me time and money. Please stop development and fix the bugs."}

The learning is rather steep in the beginning but once you got the hang of it it's easy enough.

OSM is rich in points of interest and often superior in remote places - just load the map for Ecuador and have a look at the Galapagos islands. And especially in those places w/o signal you need osmand's offline maps."}

Not a happy moment, yet often repeated. OTOH, without a gpx it works very well, aside from the occasional bizarre routing like off and immediately on at the same exit. Offline maps a must in the back country. 1.8.3, Android 4.2.1."}

Since I'm planning a trip across Europe I've been trying some different application for offline navigation and I know there are free alternatives that are able to calculate routes offline between two cities several countries apart. I'm puzzled why OsmAnd+ is not able to do this.  As a workaround, you can select a different route calculation algorithm (like OSRM), but you will need an internet connection for it to work."}

You can't just type in an address like every other mapping program in the world?  You know, based on the postal standard?  I can't even put in a street number!  Not everything on a road has a cross street!  Having the pass along the whole track is perhaps the most important thing you offer that makes it more useful than all the others.  Very important for custom routes and sightseeing that's not optimal in any way.  For me, life's a journey, not a destination.

Also searches are resulting in different choice but don't indicate what house number are hidden behind the results making it a lucky guess to where to drive and arrive. I tried several navigation apps and it is a pretty good feature pack, but i think its needs more work to make it more accessible. This is my verdict so far. I still haven't figured out what buildings supposed to be in the search. Mm... I give it 3 stars because its guided me wrongly for features it deserves more."}

I primarily used the map function and tried the voice navigation briefly  just to laugh at it. I've been a Google map user since my first Android back in 2011. Hate to admit, Google location services such as maps, navigation, latitude have all been going downhill. I since have switched to Map with me for simplicity and performance. As I am planning for the next trip I re-installed this app just to give it another try since map with me doesn't have nav. Wow, navigation works and it works really well. I was at a Costco parking lot and it showed where all the lanes are and it actually navigated me within the parking lot. One improvement it can use is to use a higher quality voice. I just noticed an update available and it could be the last frontier I've been waiting for. Keep up the great work."}

Actually have more options and fine tuning maybe then all others put together and I love this, but as for job for which is meant it is just bad(missing many times by 50/100m, indicating wrong direction, insisting for minutes to turn around sometimes even when car in mean time is already nearly at destination, long delay before recalculating new route (others i.e. Copilot, Sygic are nearly instant). Display is constantly shaking, adjusting, moving in steps, ... Navigation improves many times a lot after fresh restart of phone, but no other I have tested (Navfree, Copilot, Sygic, Navigator, ...) have this problems or maybe just once in awhile. As I have purchased will still keep it on my phone just really hope for some redone version. Then might give more then 1 star. About missing street numbers note that this is fault of OSM!!

For instance, I'm currently in the Mongol Rally, driving from London to Mongolia. To get across Russia, I need to download over 80 separate maps, as they are listed by city and not region, and figuring out which are applicable for my journey would be painstakingly long. It would be great if they could be organized by region (i.e. South-east, South-west, etc.) or if there was a file for the basic highway routes, and additional files for each city. It would be better even, if I was able to just download the whole of Russia in one go rather than storing all of them separately.  I quite frequently get a \"not enough process memory error\" despite being on the Nexus 7 with a plethora of extra process memory available. This error causes map data to not load. Additionally, the app occasionally crashes entirely with no explanation aside from \"OSMAnd+ has stopped\"  Overall, worthy of the money and totally capable of nearly all navigation needs. I was using NavFree before and prefer this, mostly for the complete database of maps, but partially due to GUI superiority."}

Driving with the family at night, the kids woke up and wanted dinner, so we just diverted our trip to the list of take away outlets. Osmand directed us directly to the location without a hitch. At our destination, we needed to find a supermarket that was still open, so we did a quick offline search and Osmand directed us to it as well.  Being a keen mapper with OSM, I have been adding pois, streets, opening hours, adding petrol stations, etc. It is very easy to add items via Osmand. After travelling, all you do is export directly to OSM and within approx 2 weeks, it is all available for everyone to use. You can also save your entire trip out as a gpx file. It couldn't be easier.  There are also a few plugins such as contour lines and hill shade -- which are great for 4wding and camping. You also have access to offline wikipedia poi."}

The interface can be improved. Making offline maps is still a pain. Preparing maps which could be used for a long trip is just too hard. Offline search seems to work well.

I suspect discrepencies between the map used to compute the road and the chown one. Direction can be random. Crashes."}
