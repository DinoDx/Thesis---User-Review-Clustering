The perfect solution", "comment": "Ifbyou say anything negative about this app, you don't understand what it does.  Creates a separate calendar with your color choices that can be accessed by a variety of standard calendar programs. Works perfectly. I would like some encryption as an enhancement. I have not tried encrpting the program. Always wanted an expanding appt list widget that was pin protected. Maybe someday. Thanks for this and great job in implenting the best solution."}
