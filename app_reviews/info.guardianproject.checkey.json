If true it will be a sad day for Google. But bravo to Guardian Project on this wonderful app. Suggestion to include more files of the apks in the system? Would be great if everything was in there."}

What good is the app if the full addresses, serial numbers and info cannot be read?  App seems to do an adequate job of finding all the data, just falls one critical step short of being usefull. Such a simple coding error guys.... fix it and five stars is yours.                        P.S. my OS=KITKAT running on an LG L90"}
