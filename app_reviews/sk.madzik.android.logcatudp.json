As of now, I've got it configured to output received packets over serial but will be enjoying myself very much when it's a single unit displaying my logcat on an LCD screen. I would like to know why I am receiving my logcat packets from source IPs external to my network? Some appear from the androids IP but most others from a handful of outside IPs. Either I've missed something simple or the app routes traffic out(hopefully unlikely)"}
