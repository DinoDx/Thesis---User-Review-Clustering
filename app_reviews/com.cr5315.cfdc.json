Now, I know this is a countdown extension, but would it also be possible to implement a way to count upwards starting from a set date/time? Perhaps it could also be a separate extension that works similarly to this one. This would allow someone to keep track of, for example, how much time has passed since some kind of event (laundry, meeting, whatever), how many days they're alive or how many days they've been in a relationship with someone."}
