Zandy doesn't seem to handle the WiFi arrow very well, so that's a very unreliable way to tell if Zandy is busy or not.  -Attachment downloading confusion: Zandy seems to start downloading another copy of an attachment when my tablet (Lenovo S6000) dims the screen, when I go to another app, or just kind of at random. There will be multiple download message boxes for the same item alternating with each other. Again, it's impossible to figure out what's going on.  -Won't see attachments without parent items: This is just kind of annoying, but as far as I can tell if you have a file -- PDF, say -- that you've put in Zotero without yet creating a parent item, Zandy can't find it."}

The app itself is far from perfect, the UI seems to be optimized for smaller screens (I'm using a 7inch tablet), but after some tinkering (see below) it does what I want it to do: it allows me to browse my library and read the papers on the tablet.  When I first installed the app, I was rather disappointed.  I use zotero for a while now and use private WebDAV space to store the documents. My main hope was that I could use the app to read those documents on the tablet, but even though the app offered a setting to put in WebDAV login data, I was not able to access it. But after some looking around, I found a solution: I used a self-certified SSL key for my web space, and hence the connection was refused by Android itself. The problem can be solved in several ways: use non-encrypted connections (maybe not so great), use \"officially certified\" keys, use the storage solution offerend by zotero itself (at least I assume this will work) or (what I did) import the certificate used into Android (also I'm not sure if this works with all Android version) as trusted CA certificate."}

The new features increases its utility greatly. Even the not completely integrated features are very well thought out. Being able to add items directly from another app is invaluable. As the release note says, the site translators are not integrated yet but these new items are tagged as 'added by Zandy'. So it is very easy to find them later on and modify them of needed. Great to see Zotero getting more and more mobile life through Zandy."}
