With regard to TASKS (\"To Dos\"), this is the only app I have found that can get my Yahoo To Do list on to the phone.  That alone is enough to give the app four stars.  The reason I don't give the app 5 stars is that my To Do list appears in one long alphabetical list rather than sorted in to categories like I have it on my computer.  Nonetheless, the To Dos are color coded according to my categories.  If I can find a way to sort the To Do list according to my categories, not just color code it to categories, I will update this review."}
