Content needs a bit more.", "comment": "The images are beautiful, the transitions flow well, the colors are perfect. There could be a few more elements for added depth.   The number of drinks is solid, if a little slim. I really enjoy the searching by liquor. It would be nice to be able to have a bar-stock option and maybe get suggestions on \"well since you have Kahl\u00faa, you may like a white russian.\"   It looks great on Lollipop though! Good job!"}
