Seems to work very well. I personally on a nexus 7 have it on 10 out of 100. Doesn't seem to be too sensitive. Would be great if it had an option perhaps at a different sensitivity to shutdown instead of merely lock.  Would be awesome with  disk based encryption."}

You simply decide how sensitive you want the application to be and it does the rest. It's useful both to protect your phone from potential pluckers and as an alternative method of locking your phone. Careful, though, of low sensitivity thresholds as they may prove more of a hindrance than anything else. At a threshold of around 2.5 I found that the phone wouldn't go off randomly or inconveniently, but would do so with a quick shake."}
