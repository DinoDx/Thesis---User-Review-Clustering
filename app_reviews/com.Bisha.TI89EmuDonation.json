The only question I have, which I'm sure there's an answer on the web, is how do you share text with other applications?  I mean, there's nothing corresponding to TI Connect, to copy files back & forth.  Where are the variables/files in the Voyage environment, stored on the android (the Nexus 7, in my case)? ...

They're incredibly small files too, in case you were wondering.  Then it's just a matter of telling this app where the file is, and boom.  Fully functioning TI-89 Titanium.  Voyage 200.  TI-92 Plus.  It's about as fully featured an emulator as one could ask for and more, including the ability to change the screen colors and install apps to the virtual calculators.

Something I would like to see is more skins. The Titanium skin is nice, and is cool to show off, but it's almost not functional because it is hard to read. I would like to see a skin similar to the titanium that is HD and high contrast. Great job on this emulator! Thanks!"}

Was fast, accurate key presses and best of all retains all of the 89 functions built into the CAS.  Wanted to be able to use my V200 rom so bought it for that.  Had a problem loading the rom since it kept giving me the TI-89 keys and screen size instead of the V200 layout.  Quit, restarted and everything worked out.  Only complaint is that you have to use the back button to access the options in the paid version where the free version has an extra icon for the settings.  Still 5 stars though as now I don't have to always carry the calculator along with me and I still know that I have the power of the 89 and V200 without having to learn some new app.  Using this on a Asus Transformer Prime TF201."}

I have bought several 89's off eBay/Craigslist just to make sure I horde enough to cover me for the rest of my life.  Now I have THIS.  This thing is SLICK.  As for the ROM, the instructions do not give much detail before you down load it.  When you install and open it, you go to settings and then navigate to the folder where your ROM is located (I just have it on the SD card).  As for getting the ROM off your old calculator, I have no idea how to do that.  You can download the latest ROM's straight from TI's website.  Go to the downloads/updates section and look for the 89 or 89 Titanium."}
