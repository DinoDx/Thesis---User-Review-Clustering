Something Dreadful has created Something Awesome. Sync is fast for me, (wifi, 40mbit), no startup issues on Android 5.0.2. Only one suggestion so far: Add a +1 button to the anime tile instead of in a submenu, and change the sub menu button for +1 to the dialogue to change the watch count and status. In my case, as I update MAL not every watched EP i'd have to tap+slide trough roughly 5 screens to get to the watch status and EP count, which IMO should be easier to reach. Also, maybe a feature request system in-app with a list of requests and request progress if being worked on, and a vote system could help for either only the beta, or both beta and release version."}
