Also, double tap for zoom does not work. Nor does two-finger zoom while writing (have to select zoom). I tried to check these settings within the app, but they were grayed out and unselectable. Also, the app does not allow the screen to be tilted, so I can't write using the length of my screen to compensate for the lack of being able to scroll across the width of the page.

Pros:  - allow you to write directly where you want the text to be added (unlike handwrite note pro), so you can allocate the right amount of space  - it has a very clean and good pencil/pen. Despite my bad handwriting skills, the result is much more readable than with other programs. It looks like it does some additional \"work\" (rounding?) over the raw input of my hand movements, or has some other magic trick ;-)   - It is very easy, fast and cheap to switch pen modes, colors and erase errors, just like with a real book. Also, it allows to use a ruler, to help drawing straight lines for graphs and things like that.  Cons:  - i'm used to leave the weight of my hand over the book, but Quill looses fast the capability to detect what i write if i do so. I don't know if there is some way to solve this problem, may be related to the capacitive touch screen itself. But again, this is not an issue so far  I think I spent well my money here, the Tablet has now the functionality for which i purchased it :-)"}

It works very well as advertised, but is missing a couple of features that you would otherwise expect to see.  The eraser, for one, can only delete entire lines, not portions of lines, so if you write cursive, you can't touch up a single letter without having to re-write the entire word.  The trade off, however is that you can very quickly erase large paragraphs or drawings.  The other thing that's missing is the ability to select text to copy/cut and paste.  That said, Quill and the digitized pen are the two things that sold me on the Lenovo Thinkpad, and I'm not disappointed.  The palm rejection works very well, and the two finger scrolling allows seamless transition between writing and repositioning your \"paper.\"  It's extremely easy to organize your notes/assignments/projects into their own separate notebooks and the tagging pages makes finding that one schematic/poem/whatever a breeze to find, and converting the notes to PDF or transferring to Evernote makes saving or sharing your notes just as easy.  Quill is a very solid app lacking only a few expected features."}

But I don't understand why a few things haven't been added (in my view this would make Quill a complete application - now it's annoying at times): 1. Why can't one order the different notes in a user-defined sort order on the main switch note screen 2. Why can't one set a default note type and have it endure to all new notes 3. Why can't one edit the graphics on the note (i.e. select some text and then cut/copy it)  Also, it's irritating that it adds underscores where I'd put spaces in the file name during export and I don't think the updating works well with Evernote; as far as I can tell it writes a new note when you re-export with the same filename. It also adds the Android path name to the Evernote filename which is not helpful at all (you then have to go and edit the Evernote filenames to recreate the filename you wanted in the first place)."}

OneNote? Forget about it. But it works in a decent manner, you can write your calculations, make lists in a hurry, show a drawing to a colleague and so on.     Now for the unpleasant part: a) it doesn't work at all on the Galaxy Note. I don't think that a Wacom stylus is so different so that Quill cannot work. b) two buttons for page navigation wouldn't hurt. Changing colour and thickness, or pages for that matter, takes too many steps.    On the whole, very good work, very useful for me at least. Thank you!"}

Also, quill doesnt really let you write small clearly, so what would fit on one paper page takes up several pages on quill, pages are free and unlimited so nbd, but the ipad app has a smaller box you can write in at a larger size and it simultaneously shows up smaller on the \"page\".

Quill is by far the best app for writing notes out there. In addition to the 2 competitors mentioned above I've purchased several other apps but none come close the the functionality and sheer joy of using Quill.   There are some areas that can be improved in Quill... but I only view them as \"nice to haves\"... and based on how frequently the developer releases updates I think it's only a matter of time until these \"wants\" are addressed.

First one is adding a new writing tool \"marker\" for painting the background behind the text. Extremely useful for emphasizing text. I am using Quill very heavily. Already migrated all my notes and writings to the Quill. Its my main application for writing at university or business meetings. Selection marker is a must tool. The idea came up while was at Microsoft courses I am currently attending. Wanted to highlight just the console commands for the PowerShell so I can easily review them later. In the header there is enough space for adding new \"marker\" icon. Hope other users will support the idea. Second suggestion is to add \"slide\" support for next/previous page since \"sliding\" is so called native interface of almost all Android apps. Using hardware volume buttons is not that good. Or at least add on-screen icons for next/previous page somewhere in the middle of the page (like the one that shows up in toolbox). Third one is not that important but will mention it anyway. Please add exit/quit command either on < icon or in menu. Hope my suggestions will make Quill more natural and intuitive."}

I found the note software that came with the Lenovo tablet lacking. I hoped this would get me started with paperless notes. It did.  The latest updates make this app perfect for my needs.  PDF export is rapid now, and the tagged notes feature lets me have virtual notebooks within the single notebook.   I backup the data to my desktop with Docs to Go and I export tagged notes as PDF notebooks that migrate to my desktop.  Thank you for a great app that you keep making better."}

If you want to replace your paper notebook that you have, this is the app to get. The notes are also in drawn in vectors with means everything will be crisp. I downloaded it for free to test it out and it has been improving very quickly with the updates, so much so that I actually paid a dollar for it. Coming from me, being very stingy with spending money on apps, means a lot. I hope the developer continues to make it even better with this."}

It is still in early development, so lacking some features. Especially, I would like to be able to set some defaults for export (e.g., page size). It would also be good to have some other export/sharing  options (e.g., via dropbox). Also, erasing via pen button would be nice."}

It's far better than Notes Mobile app that comes standard on the Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet Slate. The tag idea of organizing pages is pretty good if you plan ahead. I find that going back to tag individual pages can be really tedious. A nice addition would be some sort of interface for doing batch tagging... or perhaps even sorting simply by date?  The pen only (palm rejection) is amazing!"}

The palm rejection was good, but not great. Quill's settings allows you to completely disable finger/palm touch, which is excellent for my needs.   The responsiveness is excellent, almost no lag when writing, far better than the default notes application.   Overall, writing with Quill feels just a good, if not better, than writing on a full tablet with a wacom digitizer."}
