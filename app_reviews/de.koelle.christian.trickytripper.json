But I have to do it for this app. I'm a very frequent traveller and that too with friends. This is the best app ( after trying lot many ) for the job . easy to use , very powerful , very convenient for ppl who travel on a sharing basis. Suggestions to the dev : 1. see if u can make it in different colour schemes 2. The types, if I could edit it and make my own 3. A Widget would be lovely to access 4. Format creation option for overall view would be lovely. Awesome work guys ."}

I don't need currency exchange but like to have my currency type (Rs.) except for ($).
