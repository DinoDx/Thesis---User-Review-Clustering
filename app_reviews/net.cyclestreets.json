The main differences I see between CycleStreets and Google are 1) CycleSteets provides the name of each street, not the road number which is helpful on small back roads which are named but not numbered 2)  CycleStreets tells you when you are off route and when to turn around, Google seems to just replan the route silently (and that requires a permanent wireless connection)  3) CycleStreets confirms all 'straight ons'  at junctions. Bascially CycleStreets talks to you more often and gives you more confidence that you are on the right route.  As an aside turn by turn navigation requires GPS to be on all the time which uses loads of power.  So I don't use CycleStreets on my phone. I run the CycleStreets on a tablet tossed into my pannier which can provide many hours of GPS navigation."}

Also, voice guidance is quite good but needs a few tweaks.  It would benefit from more frequent updates on distance to turn, and more of a warning when actually approaching the turn; atm the turn warning comes when you're at the junction.  Final issue, the route marker can at times be hard to distinguish from other map icons, I'd rather colours designating road types were more subdued with the route marker being brought into bold.  Other than those, this is quite a good cycling GPS."}
