I haven't had a chance to test it out, but fast response time like that deserves five stars.  Edit #2: I was finally able to successfully change my password. Going on a hunch, it looks like this app doesn't work well with passwords with special characters in them. Originally I was trying to change the decryption password to one that contained the sequence \"$$\" in it. After changing it, on each reboot, it would not accept the password to decrypt the device. After another restore from a backup, I just attempted to change it to a password that was strictly alphanumeric with no special characters, and this time it decrypted the device fine upon reboot. Upping my rating to four stars as a result- it works, but beware if you use special characters!"}
