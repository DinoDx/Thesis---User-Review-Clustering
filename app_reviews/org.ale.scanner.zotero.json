It syncs well with my Zotero references.  My only concern is that I am unable to enter new references using ISBN numbers. When I enter the ISBN number using the \"add by identifer\" command. the app seems to go into an infinite loop and never adds the requested information.  This happens both on the Passport and the Note 8.  This severely limits its utility for mobile use in libraries, bookstores, etc.  If this problem is fixed, I would give it 5 stars."}

Very easy to enter ISBN Codes with Barcode Scanner or manually. Listing of scanned library on mobile device would be a useful feature. Can also manage app settings via personal Zotero web account.  The set up and web interface is not very intuitive or user-friendly as some have mentioned and need to play around a bit to figure it out, using manual entry of of the \"key\" that is requested (long alphanumeric string). On set up attempt also got message that account did not have write permission (i.e., ability to upload scanned item to Zotero.) If you have this message, select the appropriate permissions under \"manage key\" and then enter the new key in the appropriate field."}

Not sure how to address the problem as there is no settings feature within the app.   EDIT: Have it working now and I now can really enjoy it. More development is needed - tinkering with options is next to impossible. Likewise, the ability to have scans go to particular collections, subcollections would greatly increase the utility of the app. I'm happy to have supported the developer and I hope the app can continue improving."}

Gabe Gossett", "rating": 2, "title": "Cool, once I got it working", "comment": "The biggest problem with this app is that the set up is a pain, or it was for me anyhow. Neither the manual or automatic API key set up worked for me for a few days. I'm not 100% that it is an issue with this app, since it may be on the Zotero side, but it still impacts the performance. I think the issue with me was that I had multiple keys with the same Scanner for Zotero title. Once I cleared those out I was still not able to get it to work automatically, but (weirdly) I could manually set it up from the key that was generated with the automatic request.  The other major issue was that I emailed for support over a week ago and have yet to hear back.   In terms of functionality now that it is working the app has been fine. However, not all books come through. It would be cool if, when a book does not scan through, the app would give you an option to add it through field entry. Even better yet, if it allowed adding through OCRed text.  Overall, this app has some promise, but probably is not going to be worth the hassle unless you really need something to add a lot of book entries from print copies."}
