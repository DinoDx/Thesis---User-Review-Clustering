Ad free!  2. Tiny size  3. As simple to use as possible  Disadvantage:  Can't prevent your device from sleeping  Before finding this excellent application, I was almost frustrated. There is a ton of `free' torch/flashlight apps and all the ones I tried, including 3 the most popular ones, annoyed me with constantly changing ads. They also required tons of permissions and their size was 1+ Megabytes. I was puzzled: how on Earth can an app turning your camera's LED on and off weigh 3 Megabytes and require unlimited permission to use the network and many, many more permissions?  The answer is obvious: they need the permissions to download the ads and annoy you, and bloated size of the app is probably due to fancy images they contain.  This app (AB ITS Inc Flashlight Ad Free) is very different. No permissions are required other than what's needed to turn the LED on/off. The size is tiny (30 Kilobytes!). No ads.  You need to understand though a 30 KB app has to be very simple. No fancy graphics, no options."}
