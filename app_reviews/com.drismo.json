Unfortunately this is far from being it. It confuses bad road surfaces with bad driving. Driving up or down steep hills gives you a negative score and anything over a medium acceleration puts you in the red again. Taking a corner at more than 5 miles an hour gets you in the red too. Maybe this works well in suburban environments with perfect road surfaces in a car with incredibly soft suspension but in the UK countryside, forget it. If you really want to know how well you drive, talk to the IAM or ROSPA, this app is useless. (Phone is a stock galaxy S3. Test vehicle Daewoo Musso over 52.5 miles and Nissan Primera over 31.4 miles)."}
