Why? Because: - it's VERY SIMPLE and VERY EASY to use (just push the big buttons after you move a piece on a chess board or press the || button to pause the game); - it's VERY EASY to configure SETTINGS (also you can choose to play at the end of the game your own sound! Very nice this feature! For example, I made my own mp3 sound, with robot voice, and when the time is finished, it's start to \"scream\": \"Time's up! You lost!... Are you ready for a new game?\"...  :) ); - it's VERY NICE,  because both players can see their own watch in front of them ( not like others chess clocks witch one of the players must read his time upside down! ). Also you can't miss your time, because it's quite large (was nice if it was larger, but np) and when remain 1 min its change colour in green (when time's up, become red!:)); - it's VERY USEFUL, because don't let your let your screen to enter in power off and miss your time (like other chess clocks); - it's GREAT because has NO virus, advertising or other codes that can harm your android! Thank you developer for this GREAT application and keep it like this!"}
