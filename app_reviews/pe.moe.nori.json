The only flaw is that the images are blurry when I see them fullscreen.  Great app, keep it up!  Oh, and an option to open booru directly with the app would be nice too, if possible."}

As of the date of this review, Nori fails to fully load images from any booru. I can only confirm of this from a Nexus 7: perhaps it works fine with other devices. Nori is a promising app that requires some time to grow into something more solid. I recommend to at least try it out and to track its progress."}
