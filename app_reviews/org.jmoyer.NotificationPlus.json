When I installed to test (set to 1 minute intervals) , it continued to notify (ring and vibrate) with no apparent way to stop it (it notified continuously)   When I cleared the notifications and voicemail, it started notifying again.  I had to force close it.  I would like to know how it is supposed to work.  I'm giving 3 stars because it does notify again, which I want.  Would be 5 star plus if it followed it protocol."}

The vibrate feature should be disabled when the phone is on silent (as opposed to vibrate mode)! Buzzing in your pocket at the cinema might be ok, but all on a night-stand it's really annoying!"}
