After Android reflash and upgrade to 5.1.1 am getting wild results when logging that seem to have the GPS fixes jumping all over the place, e.g.  Aberdeen Scotland one minute and London 30 secs later, a difference of over 600km. Never  had this before. As a registered blind person I use this to log my train journeys and track them on Google using my PC later. Any help to fix what was a really enjoyable experience is much appreciated. Thanks."}

Turned on my phone's GPS and started this GPS Logger app from inside my office building.  Took me about 1 minute to get outside, walked about 20 minutes and then turned it off when I got back inside.  It said I walked over 7 miles for a route I know is much less than 2 miles.  At least this version is better than the previous one, that only logged points if my phone was on and the app was active.  What I think should be changed is that when logging it started it should not start until the GPS gets a lock.  I think it's using the previous location, which it should not do.  And settings should show in their menu item instead of having to select each item to see what the value is."}

This seems pretty close, there are just two things that I would like to see: 1. Different update frequencies for when plugged in versus battery power. On Backitutde, I had it updating every minute when plugged in and ten minutes on battery; this was a nice balance between accuracy and battery use. When I wanted more frequent updates, I'd plug it into the car charger or portable charger.  2. The ability to upload KMLs once a day. Currently the longest it will wait is eight hours between updates. I would love to see the ability to create a new KML every day at a fixed time (midnight or user-configurable) then upload the previous one at that time, so, for example, my Drive folder has a pile of KMLs that each correspond to a specific date."}

However, once loaded on google earth there were many points that were not accurate at all, especially when the airplane was doing anything other than flying straight and level.  Points were very erratic in position, altitude, and speed.  At a few points the altitude was > 30,000ft, and sometimes faster than 600mph.  I was only flying a single engine propeller plane.  Using the option in google earth to pin the points to the ground to view the ground track showed that the path itself also looked very off.  Again, flying straight and level seemed just fine, but when climbing or descending accuracy went to hell.  Logging frequency was set to 2 seconds, saving as a .gpx format, not using satellite time, and the phone was not in airplane mode."}
