In Hearing Saver, a large chunk of the lowest part of the slider is vibrate and it took a lot of trial and error to set the lowest volume that hasn't disabled the ringer. It would be great if all the way down was vibrate and anything slightly above it was audible -- or if the sliders were the same as the system ones (not sure if that's possible).  Or it could be nice to just apply the \"Save last volume\" to all plugged. (So I can use the phone's media and ringtone volume control to set the plugged and unplugged volumes.)  Aside from that, it's great to stop the deafening notification sounds when I use headphones. The \"Save last pluggedvolume\" feature is awesome."}

I appreciate the warning the first time, but not every single time I use the headphones. I've been searching for an app like this for a long time. I'm not quite a tech guru to do all of the rooting or whatever they call it to modify the phone, but I can install Hearing Saver with ease. Thank you not because you saved my hearing but for saving my head from exploding. Of course for someone who likes to listen to music soft or at any given volume level that they like, Hearing Saver would be able to help you as well. 2 thumbs up!!!!!"}

For all of those out there with half a brain who get sick and tired of plugging your phone into your car or home stereo and then having to turn up the volume on your phone after it turned itself down to \"protect your ears\", THIS IS THE APP FOR YOU!  Works great, I plug my cord in LG tells me loud volumes can damage my ears, this app turns the volume to max, or wherever you set it really.  You're so thoughtful LG, maybe you should think about protecting users bodies against broken glass and steering wheels when they've gotten in an accident for having to screw around with the volume on there phone!!!"}
