It also, for some boggling reason, can't be controlled from the lock screen, so better just set it and forget it in your car, or you're probably going to die.

Also, NPR does an excellent job of keeping its listeners/ readers informed, especially with this app. For example, meaningful discussions and various programs are offered in different states, while other TV sources focus on Obama's tan jacket."}

I have been able to listen to NPR program without much hassle and only intermittently experience playback issues or glitches.  I think that the app is becoming quite polished and I appreciate your dedication to updating the catalog of audio files by bringing more shows to the app.  One improvement that I would like to see is an integration between the website and your apps.  Sometimes I find myself browsing NPR and wishing I could continue a story on my mobile device at a later point if I am on the move.  The addition of a saved articles or read-it-later type functionality would be awesome.  Another key feature would be a unified playlist that syncs between app and our profiles on the website.   I like to stream your app in my car and it would be nice to add stories I am interested in from my computer and play them on my mobile device when I get into my car.  Currently, there does not appear to be any profile functionality on the mobile app.  Keep up the great work.  I really enjoy using this app as a source for news and culture."}

I haven't noticed it skipping songs when buffering.  The big improvement I see is adding play/pause/skip to the lock screen when the app is playing. This also connects into bluetooth devices like the Jambox. I can pause my playlist or skip a story from my Jambox. Great addition!  A pet-peeve of mine with the app is the confirmation dialog every time I clear the playlist. I primarily use the app for news stories so I clear the playlist daily to remove outdated segments. A better solution would be to allow playing of all segments in a program (ie. Morning Edition) without adding them to the playlist.  If you added a way for me to donate to the app, via Paypal for instance, I would give!"}

I never know if it's going to work or not, but I keep using it on the off chance it does load right. I can add shows to my queue but whether or not it actually loads right is a gamble.   Sometimes I load things, give up, and a couple hours later it starts to play out of the blue (really nice when I'm in situations like a work meeting, and my phone starts blaring) I'm giving it 2 stars because when it works, it's so nice (I can listen to entire programs, which I like since I have a few I like to listen start to finish, like Morning Edition) but honestly NPR - with the constant reviews and complaints about how buggy this app is, you really need to get it together and fix it.   I've been using the NPR app for years now, and the revamp they did about 1.5 years ago ruined it. It'd be better if they just rolled it back to the older app than having people constantly battle the current one."}

Simply trying to play the stories of Morning Edition or All Things Considered by tapping \"Add all to playlist\" and then starting the playlist results in random jumps to the next playlist item, starting in the middle of items, and skipping items altogether.  It's hard to believe that the developers are testing this app with much rigor.  I think some dogfooding would help expose its more frustrating issues.  I've experienced identical problems with the app on my Samsung GS II, Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and Nexus 5.  All that said, the app isn't totally worthless, so 2 stars instead of 1.  If NPR would let us get the MP3s for these programs from a regular RSS feed like some of the other shows, then I'd use my own podcast manager like Pocket Casts, but NPR still doesn't allow this for some reason.  I am a member of an NPR member station, but I would be totally willing to pay for this app if it were better and if the fee helped continue its development support."}

It doesn't play well with Google maps navigation: every time the navigation cuts in to give a direction you hear another startup advertisement, so I can't use it while I'm driving.

I see other reviews complaining about a previous version having landscape orientation but poor screen layout for small phone displays.  It would be nice if this same mode would be brought back, I am sure that the space issue would be negligible for those of us working off of tablets.  I would give 5 stars if not for this issue."}

The only other app I currently bother using for news is BBC. I love how organized the app is, and how it has several features that make it easy to consume the many various aspects of NPR, such as listening to certain shows, finding your favorite station, listening to/reading stories by your preferred category, and the ability to share. However, I feel that there is room for improvement. Each story in the queue takes up quite a lot of space on the screen with a great deal of dead space for each line. Maybe this is good for users with poorer vision, but I prefer to have more content on my screen so I don't have to do as much scrolling. I'm also not especially fond of the audio bar at the bottom of the screen, as it takes up as much real estate as one news item. If it were consolidated to the top of the screen, I could browse more stories instead of essentially having a giant button. Lastly, I wouldn't mind spending a few dollars for this app if it meant eliminating advertisements at the bottom of the screen. Aside from these complaints, I'm quite happy with NPR's mobile app. Keep up the excellent journalism!"}

I am using it on my month and half old Google Nexus 4 and there are several things wrong with it. While streaming my local station, it will often lose connection and go silent and I will need to come back to the phone and hit the play button again or even sometimes restart the app entirely. Somehow my favorite stations will disappear from the list. The widget will not play my local station's stream without first opening the app and hitting play from within the app. What's the point of the widget then? And finally there's the playlist problems. For example, I will add all of the clips from the show 'Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me' and it will sometimes duplicate one of the clips. While playing the clips it will skip over clips and sometimes will start playing clips not from the beginning like it should but from one or two minutes into the clip. I hope all of these issues can be resolved. I do love NPR!"}

Still a few issues, but for the most part, now that I have learned how to manipulate it to avoid the pitfalls, it works flawlessly most of the time.  I can definitely understand the frustration out there though.  Here is an issue I have positively identified:  When the playlist contains a story that is shorter in length than the next story, the second story will begin playing where the first one left off, cutting off the beginning (or indeed sometimes MOST OF) the next story.  So, if story1 is 3:02, and story2 is 4:25, story 2 will begin playing at 3:03.  I imagine that would be easy to fix with an additional check at the beginning of the process of moving to the next story.  Another item that happens, and I don't know why, but I suspect it may have to do with audio availability: when looking at a programs' stories, if it is at or near the beginning of the playtime on the first stations to run the story, the app sometimes crashes.  Third item:  when streaming, app will turn itself off 5 minutes after starting the stream.  Could this be the result of the previous story's playtime being reached?  Keep up the good work!"}

NPR is great, and this app is the best way to consume NPR. I never listen to my local station anymore (not even when in the car). This app makes the broadcast format as obsolescent as the internet does for dead-tree content.  But the app itself is terrible. The design is a bit quirky but serviceable. The problem is mainly it is BUGGY as all get-out. I have used this app for 2+ years, on 4 different Android phones, on equally as many versions of Android, on wif-fi and on mobile data. So it is definitely not merely an isolated \"fragmentation\" issue. It is the app itself. I experience the following problems, at a frequency of probably 1 per 15 minutes:  - New story starts mid-stream - App freezes for 15-60 seconds, then starts playing (not buffering, app itself is frozen) - App force closes  There have been many updates, but none have improved reliability perceptibly.  I would definitely pay to get a better app. 99% of the time I love that NPR is blissfully free from commercial pressures. This is one exception--no for-profit company with competition would let such a high-potential product langusih this way. :("}

Freezes; it doesn't as often happen as often on my HTC Evo 3D but it still happens. I also get skips when one story finishes and then when the next in the playlist plays (and there is usually a sometimes very long wait for the next story to play) very often most of the next story has been skipped. I only get the final 30 seconds of that story. I've also found that when the app is interrupted by and incoming call, whether that call is taken or rejected, the sound through my bluetooth device (headphones, car audio) from the app is gone. While other apps are able to play through bluetooth audio, NPR is silent and can't access bluetooth audio until the phone is rebooted. I realize that building an app that has to work on multiple different hardware, software and networks options is a challenge but most other developers seem to be doing a much better job getting this done than those who have designed with app."}

The playlist feature is also difficult to use. I'd happily reinstall this app if there's a major upgrade, but as it stands, I can't justify it taking up space on my phone. (It can't be stored on my SD card, which is another negative.)"}

But there are two exceptions, on my G2:  1. When I am listening to a live stream, and I get a notification in my notifications bar (e.g., a new email), the app quits playing for a moment so that I can get the audio notification, and disappears from my notifications bar, because the notifications bar is temporarily reserved for the new notification.  But when the new notification fades and the regular notification bar returns, the NPR app appears for only a second before disappearing entirely, and the app never begins playing the news again.  If I am still on the app, then I can easily restart the stream by unlocking my phone and pressing \"play\" again, but I shouldn't have to work this hard for it.  2. When I switch from wifi to 4G, it takes the phone a moment to find the 4G data stream.  If I activate the app before the phone finds the 4G data stream, and choose to look at my Favorite Stations, clicking on one of my Favorite Stations does not take me to that page; instead, it removes my favorite station from the list, and I have to search for it and re-add it again.

I've been trying to use this app for a long time--NPR's programing is really compelling--but this app is so buggy that I end up frustrated almost every time I try using it. The sorts of bugs I'm talking about: freezing up... and then suddenly starting playing again 10 minutes later, when you've moved on to something else; unpredictably starting programs in the middle instead of the beginning; and freaking out if you move between WiFi and cellular connectivity during a program. It's also missing the single most obvious feature it should have: you can't pre-load programs to listen to when you don't have an internet connection. Further, it doesn't even try to start loading a program until the previous one is completely finished--so you get a gap between programs who'se length depends on the quality of your connection. These could be forgiven in a new app... but this app has been out for years and the only updates it's received have made it noticeably *more* buggy (in fairness, they did give us a great new feature, though: in-app ads...).

So support your local NPR station, even though the network releases crap software like this.)  This is a fact: phone data connections flake out. Radio shadows, not enough cell towers, bad karma, whatever, you can't assume your data connection works perfectly every single second. And a good mobile streaming app deals with this.  This app does not. Run out of buffer on a live stream, and the app simply resets the stream, meaning you have to listen to the station's opening blurb over and over and over. Run out of buffer on a queued story, and the app simply skips to the next story? What idiot thought that made sense?  To listen to an NPR station on your device, install a generic MP3 streaming client like StreamFurious. If the client doesn't already have your station in its database, go to the station's web site, find the MP3 stream URL, and copy it into the client.  Can't think of a way to queue up NPR stores the way this app does. Too bad, it's a cool feature."}

I had to pull the battery to kill it.  Uninstalled for now, waiting for someone to fix this.  I can't believe how apps get released with no testing.

If your local NPR affiliate doesn't carry your preferred programming, this is a great option. For that reason, I want to love this app, but I can't.   GOOD:   1) selection of programs and podcasts;   2) you can create a playlist;  3) you can listen live;  4) many program episode lists are archived so you can listen to programs that are \"older\";  5) multiple searches;  6) you can program radio presets. I assume this lets you listen in your car via BlueTooth.  BAD:  1) some programs have only that day's episodes, so you can easily miss out;  2) the \"clear list/played\" buttons are badly placed so that it's easy to delete programs before you intend to. This is particularly frustrating given #1;  3) I can't fast forward on my phone. There is a slide bar and I can do this on my tablet;  UGLY:  1) the app force closes A LOT;  2) there's no QUIT button so it runs in the background even after you stop it.Sometimes it will restart itself if I don't close through TaskManager.  I want to love it, but I can't. This NPR member isn't impressed. Hoping for improvements in future updates. Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant"}

While it's free, my expectations should be low but if NPR wants to increase its listener base, they need to throw a few more $ towards making a stable app.  It seems to know to cut out whenever I'm particularly interested in the topic of discussion, of course.  I use several other audio streaming apps and they only cut out when signal is weak - the NPR app cuts out randomly and frequently regardless of signal strength.    Also, I would like to have a simple \"exit\" or off button.  The lack thereof makes it a multi-step process to sign out of the app - to shut it down entirely I have to click the PAUSE button to stop it playing, back out through all of the screens to exit, then kill it through the app-killer.  This is a silly pain and it makes me only listen when a particularly important show is on.  I might use it more frequently if it was easier and worked better."}

It seems to be building a very large initial buffer, even when on wi-fi.   Second, the stability of the streams is terrible. I like to sleep with the radio on all night.
