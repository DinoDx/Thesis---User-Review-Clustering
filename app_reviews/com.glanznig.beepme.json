Application fills a void and would be really nice to use, it has a fancy site for something that doesn't work. Sure it gives a \"pling\", but one can't make an entry, apparently you have to hover over the phone like a hawk, I suppose. So, you want random bell sound, you got it. Other than that though..   As I said, it's a real shame, an open source application like this could be really useful for all kinds of purposes. I was a bit exited till I found out it don't even got the basics down.  v.1.5.5 is waste of space xCover 2, android 4.1.2."}
