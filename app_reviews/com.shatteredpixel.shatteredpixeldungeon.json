The second is that you implement something to do after beating the game. Maybe a hard mode, or boss rush, or new dungeon.

It was cursed and so the item card said its powers were chaotic and unstable.I liked the random effects so i kept the curse, and when i got to level 5 and fought goo,i hit it with a blast from the wand and it turned goo into a sheep. When the sheep disappeared there was no key and i was basically stuck on the floor and had to restart the run. Quite a shame if this would happen late game. Fix it and keep up the awesomeness!"}

It's worth reading a guide so you understand the mechanics of the game (for example, you never miss enemies coming through a doorway: that's an easy way to hit wraiths and crabs). Overall, it's a great game if you like challenging rogue likes."}

This version has some excellent ideas (I especially liked the rogue's cloak), but the original does a better job of balancing weapons and abilities, meeting closer at the happy medium between difficulty and playability. Also, this version doesn't have Google+ cloud saving. This is by no means a bad game, you will like it if you like the original, I just prefer the original."}

The landscape mode doesn't really work very well though. It is massively zoomed out and the UI is tiny despite having the \"scale up UI\" option enabled.

I don't mind playing in portrait mode."}

After *only* 20 games, I managed to kill the goo and advance a couple of levels after that. However, while I know it's intentional, it's too much luck based. I love it when the game rewards me for being clever, and I feel down when a string of bad luck wastes a good character and I can't do anything to prevent it other than pray that some of the unidentified items may somehow save me, so 4/5. Keep up the good work!"}

That is my favourite feature of this game. But this version seems to hold your hand a bit more than the original. Its slightly more forgiving as well due to the addition of hero bones allowing you to get some stuff back from your previous game. Powerful items seem more common and cursed less so. Dont get me wrong the game is still amazing ly fun, but in terms of balancing I still find the dwarven floors to be the most difficult part of the game and is harder to pass than hell."}

It's engaging, very fun, challenging, and addictive, which is exactly what most folks look for in a game. The fact that it's free is icing on the cake. The interface is streamlined very well and you can tell a lot of thought and effort was put into this mod of an already awesome game. I'm giving it 5 stars, but I do have some comments...  Having run through dozens of times, I'm realizing I'll most likely never get to see even half of what's on offer here. I understand these types of games are going to be hard, but this one is pretty brutal. Most of the items you will need to succeed just don't materialize. I walk around a majority of the time with a pack full of unidentified items, starving to death, with almost no health... Again, I know that's the intent...  But then I win the lottery on a playthrough and the game showers you with identify scrolls, health potions, food, and vegetation early on. Then I realized, being good at this game is not near as important as what random stuff the engine gives you... And that is discouraging..."}

Unfortunately, it seems the balance between heroes needs to be reworked a bit. Rogue seems to be the best choice for going through a full game because of their ability to get bonus evasion from armor with lower strength requirement. Followed by warrior, then mage then huntress. However the character that I like the most is the mage but I find his abilities don't work very well into later game where the rogues evasion bonus works wonders."}

Great new mechanics, don't like the quest with the Gnoll rogue, he hits too hard early on, with no way to get him other than waiting 20-30 turns for him to wander away. Late game is hard and counter acts everything you had after Tengu (2nd boss), I had glaive +7 and ring of accuracy +4, got my weapon kicked out my hands and deferred,  found myself with 14 heal pots', deference killed me just before the king of dwarves. Overall, good game at beginning, just sucks at late game. [Edit] May I note that I beat normal pixel dungeon and was quite easy with similar equipment, this is just too hard :{"}

There are a few things missing from the original (which I un installed   due to memory issue with my phone) so i hope to to see them in shattered. I see alot of people complain, but it just takes a couple tries to beat the goo, and its so exciting when you make a good character, and then equally dissapointing when you die on like level 18, but that's just how the game is played. Also I really lik the rogue in this one"}
