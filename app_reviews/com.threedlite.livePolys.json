These mathematically precise beauties will keep you entertained for hours. I've been keeping a logbook of my polyhedral encounters and so far I've managed to observe the famed tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, dodecahedron, cuboctahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, and geodesic polyhedrons. However the famed bucky ball still eludes me. One day, I will have mastered all of these intriguing shapes.  These graphics are astounding. There's no doubt in my mind that in the future, people will be asking: \"yes, but does it run ThreeDLite Live Wallpaper?\" when purchasing a phone. That's how much I love this app."}
