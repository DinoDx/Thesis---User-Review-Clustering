It was very hard to read as the lines overlapped each other on my phone (LG P870).  Then after that, I couldn't figure out how to attack the obstacle in the way or move past it.  Very frustrating.  Finally, put the tutorial in the game, not a website where its now buried or gone please."}

Regardless, a man can only take so many random crashes without flying into a fit of RAGE.  Basically, great game, unimaginably awful implementation."}
