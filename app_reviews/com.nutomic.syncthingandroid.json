Recommended, for now, but it needs to keep improving."}

You can sync the whole Android disk if you want, though you will have to do it from the web interface and type manually the path (otherwise the filepicker is not very good).  It's sometimes very handy for transfering files without having to use any wires or to keep on sync savefiles, configurations, documents, etc.  The GUI mimics the web interface behavior.. it kind of makes you wonder why did they bother writing a dedicated GUI when they could have simply opened the web interface from a webview and just made sure it uses proper html5/css3 tricks to be suitable for small devices. Specially since you might still want to use the web interface to add paths."}

Syncthing achieves complete transparency with regard to source-code, and it requires both sides to confirm each other's access before sharing repository contents. With this novel approach to transparency and this crucial two-factor requirement, Syncthing is the security-conscious individual's choice, hands-down.  The only area in which Syncthing is lacking is on the desktop. On the desktop, Syncthing runs as a standalone app (not in itself a \"bad thing\"), but it does require advanced knowledge to, for example, start Syncthing on boot or login. (For the interested, this can be done using the operating system's task scheduler: \"cron\" on Mac and Linux, and Task Scheduler on Windows.) BTSync and others make this process simple and the application runs as a service, in the background, by default when started (with the option to start upon login)."}
