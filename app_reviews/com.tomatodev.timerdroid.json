The setup for making new timers is easy, along with the ability to save timers into groups with names. There are also options to change how the alarm feature works when the timer stops. I have not run into any issues when running multiple timers, but the potential use of having multiple timers is huge. TimerDroid gives the ability to run multiple timers with a good set of extra useful features very easily and cleanly."}
