Where is the repository downloaded to? I can find /sdcard/git-repos but all that is there is the git control files, where is the repository itself?  Obviously my next request is please can we have commits and push?  Thanks Mark"}

I can review changes from the bus, the bathroom, the park, the lunch break, keep my head in the code at all times if I please. Regarding other reviews: easier importing of github repos would be nice; I don't care much for implementing the push feature (until I get a bluetooth keyboard, my smartphone is not my development environment). Tough little app, nice animated diffs, might be addictive."}
