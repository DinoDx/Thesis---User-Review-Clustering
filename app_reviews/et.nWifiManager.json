It never notifies me when both Mobile and WiFi connections are gone. The messages could be clearer. When I leave home and lose my wifi connection, the notification is that mobile data is now enabled  I would love to see a desc of when not if is triggered.  I just enabled preference to show alt icon when wifi is lost and several times it has changed to that icon and notified me wifi is lost even though it is not. Opening app puts back the correct 'connected' icon."}

You can't keep app sound working when you disable notification icon, you also can't keep sound notification on an change pull down notification to display bssid, or ip...so it just has to be basic the more you change in setting the less it might work.

At the moment the app warrants 4.5 stars, so I rounded up to 5. With one or two small changes, it will be a fulL 5 star app :).  SUGGESTIONS TO DEVELOPER:  1. Config option to remove the status icon. 2. It would be useful to be able to see the top-level IP as well as the local IP. 3.  Also would be nice to see the link speed in the notification bar"}
