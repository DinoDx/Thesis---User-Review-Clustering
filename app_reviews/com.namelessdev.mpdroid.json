It's actually better than several full desktop clients I've tried.  It's easy to use, does a great job of displaying cover art (check the mpdroid wiki), lets you browse by folder structure or by tags and is all round very neat.  The only long term annoyance I've noticed compared to a desktop client like gmpc is it doesn't support the composer metadata field but anyway it does let you go to the album folder so if you have any kind of sensible tagging and naming scheme you can always get the info you need.  MPDroid improves with each release and MPD + MPDroid still has a place as a great way to enjoy your music collection, even in these days of DLNA/UPNP devices."}
