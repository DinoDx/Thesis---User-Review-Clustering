I have a question about using the app. I added a podcast that has over a hundred existing episodes. I would like to listen to it starting with the oldest episode first because it is a serial and I'd like to follow the storyline.  Is adding each old episode to the queue manually the only way to listen oldest to newest? That's a lot of scrolling and clicking.  The way I understand antennapod's use seems great for staying current with podcasts, but difficult for listening to old casts.  Is there a way to use antennapod in that way?  I saw on github a feature request to \"add all to queue\", that would probably do it.  Also, I tried emailing the google group but it bounced back.  Thanks for your help, I greatly appreciate it."}

The open podcast database it uses always finds what im looking for.

Others miss episodes or download in weird orders or at inappropriate times. That doesnt happen with antennapod. I highly recommend this outstanding app!"}

I haven't found another podcast app that I'm happier with, yet. The new UI feels a little more intuitive, but the ability to add an episode to queue now takes too many clicks - I generally want to add to queue instead of download, so the big download button doesn't do it for me and instead is a waste of space!"}

In terms of what I'd like to see improved, there are a few things.  First, an easier way to add podcasts would be nice, like some kind of directory to search through. I had to add This American Life by pasting in the URL rather than using a search or selection activity.  Second, adding fast-forward and rewind to the lockscreen would be good.  Third, selection of items is a little clunky, and it takes too many clicks to perform operations on items in the list. One should be able to mark something unread in two clicks, but it takes three because the menu doesn't pop up automatically after selection.  Fourth, marking things read/unread, adding and removing to the queue, and managing the downloaded/not downloaded statuses of all of the items isn't as easy as it could be. It's kind of a pain to have to separately manage all of these statuses independently. Also, auto-removal from the queue seems to work, but auto-removal from the device doesn't seem to work.  And lastly, auto-downloading of items would be nice.  Overall though, a great app!"}
