Mobile version of RTKLIB.", "comment": "It is really a very good job indeed!  It provides a nice platform to integrate the satellite corrections into the mobile GPS via NTRIP.  It is great if it can correct the position of the internal gps of smartphone.  But anyway you have put a big step forward in this matter.  In Hong Kong, the SatRef satellite corrections (DGPS & RTK) are free of charge and it is definitely great if they can be applied into mobile phone.  I was surprised serval years ago when i tested the ublox low cost single frequency GPS receiver with the RTKLIB.  I really hope that same surprise can appears in my phone.  Thanks!"}

I've been playing with RTK-Lib for several years and I'm really excited to see this come to Android. I don't have an Android device at the moment, but I can confirm that it runs on Android-x86 project if anyone wants to check it out on their PC.  Only downside so far is that it doesn't appear to support serially connected (ie. wired) devices, which would be useful in embedded projects using U-Blox or SkyTraq (SF1315F-RAW) receivers.  Great job!!"}
