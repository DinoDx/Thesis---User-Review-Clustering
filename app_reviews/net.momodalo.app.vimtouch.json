Then my phone kept rebooting.  I'm an IT Architect, so I knew what to do.  It took me a while -- a couple of weeks, of uninstalling a couple of other apps along with this one (the apps I had installed just before the phone started rebooting), then re-installing them (over days!) and then uninstalling, and so on.  As I say, that took many days, since I would have to wait for a couple of days to see if the phone would reboot or not .I finally was able to conclusively prove that it was only after I installed Vim Touch that the phone kept rebooting.  I have now had it uninstalled for a couple of weeks, I've reinstalled the other apps, and my phone is not rebooting.  Since it does not run all the time in the background, all I can figure is that there is something that is going haywire during the install itself, causing problems later on.  File corruption?  Something not being registered right?  I haven't done any Android development, just UNIX and Linux (since 1980!), so I don't know what to tell you.  Fix that issue and you've got 5 stars from me."}

And oh wow: *don't* try using vim encryption. Hangs and force quits everywhere. Then it made 3 of my files become zero size.  All my 40+ others apps are working fine. I can't understand the 5 stars for Vim Touch. Perhaps people are just enjoying it as a toy or a novelty. But if you try to do anything half-serious with it it will break and take some of your files with it.                    (HTC one rooted with very stable CM10 and no problems in other apps)"}

I have to use a silly combination of function and control keys to get it. - Now that I have edited and saved a file, how do I send it and use it elsewhere??? I would appreciate an upload or send feature,  as in the Photo Gallery. Now I have to hunt down the files with a file manager or do it with a console. This should be easier!"}

Doesn't work with bluetooth keyboard.", "comment": "I used to use Terminal IDE for its VIM, and was eagerly waiting for a native VIM app. Many thanks to the developers for their effort on this app. As it is VIM, users shouldn't expect to use it well with a soft keyboard. However, I found that even when using my hardware bluetooth keyboard (Sony Tablet S, Sony bluetooth keyboard), there are some problems.  1. The ctrl key does not work. More specifically when I'm using ctrl-d and ctrl-u to scroll down and up (by a half-page) respectively. The app doesn't seem to be aware that the ctrl key was pressed.  2. What I like about the VIM in Terminal IDE is that there is an toggle option to set the Android \"back\" key as the esc key. This app (by default, as of 26 April 2012) uses \"tap screen\" as the esc key. I wish I could configure it so that the Android \"back\" key were the esc key.  3. There is no obvious way to configure vimrc. I wish this were included in the options.  If all these problems above, or even just the first two, were addressed, then this app would definitely be 5 stars. Hell I would even pay a reasonable amount for it."}

This app is what you're looking for when you have a phone with a hardware keyboard. Or perhaps you use a bluetooth keyboard, as I sometimes do. In these cases the app works as you'd expect.  Most phones use a soft keyboard nowadays. This is where \"Vi IMproved Touch\" falls short. The app doesn't compensate for the presence of the soft keyboard. You end up hiding and showing the keyboard constantly. Not usable."}

A couple of suggestions:  1) please default the write path to /mnt/usb_storage when a usb stick is inserted 2) -2* because I get an unresponsive, white screen when I return to your vim window from any other app. This makes your vim basically useless to me, since I have to power off tablet to clear vim out of the running program stack.  I'll eventually root, see if that fixes 2)"}
