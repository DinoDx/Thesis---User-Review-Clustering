It's clean, clutter and ad free, simple and vibrant. The blocks look great and the music is wonderful. The only drawback is that your points for scoring a line flashes right at you on the screen. This can be extremely annoying when you're playing the higher levels like 19+ would be great if the scores didn't flash at me and were so distracting. Would be 5/5 otherwise."}

But in this game it doesnt matter. So why should advance players start at a higher level when we dont get more points? Tnis app is full of ,alware.apps self install thereselves dont get this!"}

The controls are smooth and simple, the settings are very customizable and is just a pleasure to play.  However, I find that the game feels slightly cramped at the top of the screen: the inability to infinitely spin means less time to adjust blocks to fit in right positions at the top of the screen, especially at high levels. Despite this, I find that it adds an extra dimension of challenge to the game.  Well done!"}
