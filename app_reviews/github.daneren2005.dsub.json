There are only a couple of new things added.  The crash is something that I would never have triggered because of how I have my server setup, so even if I did an update in a year I wouldn't have found the issue.  An update will be going out in a couple of hours which should fix it."}

Many times, when I skip to the next track on the playlist, there is no music playing even though the progress bar and time is moving along. The only way to get it playing is to press the pause button and then press play again. This happens in offline mode as well as online mode. It didn't always do this before, so I don't know what happened. I've used this player for well over a year, but this problem just started like a month or two ago. *update*: I did try reinstalling Dsub, but after reinstalling, i found that it remembered all of my settings. I found that the playback problem seems to be related to my bluetooth speaker (UE Boom). When i use dsub w/o the bluetooth speaker, everything seems to behaves normally. Very strange problem. Possibly the player stops sending signals to the speaker in between song skips and it has trouble reinitiating when the next song starts? I can hear slight clicky sounds on the bluetooth speaker when skipping tracks."}

My only gripe is the lack of support for multiple tags in the same field, i.e. tags separated by some separator, for example \"jazz;free jazz;experimental\" as the genre tag, which should result in the song being found under all of the three genres listed, or \"Sunn O)));Boris\" as the artist field, which should result in the song (and the whole album of the song) being listed under both the artists \"Sunn O)))\" and \"Boris\". This is the way squeezeserver operates and really should be the standard, but I am yet to find a mobile music streaming app that allows this basic functionality. Edit: Changed the rating to 5 stars after a developer reply explaining that lack of multiple tag/tag separator issue is a limitation of the subsonic server itself and not due to app design."}

I realize the Chromecast is fairly new, so the rating may seem unfair, however this app doesn't seem to be much different from the actual Subsonic app. At least not different enough to justify the price.   I'm using this on a Nexus 10 which can be fickle about WiFi connections. Yet, it streams Netflix and other Chromecast enabled content without issue. Dsub, stops playing albums & playlists for no reason. Physically connecting the N10 to the stereo and using the Subsonic app to connect to my server has no streaming issues.  If you don't like ads, by all means purchase this app for use with your Subsonic server. I appreciate that someone is developing apps for use with Subsonic and I am happy to contribute. Unfortunately, my expectations are not yet met."}

The app icon is a bit cheesy, but has no affect on functionality, so, can't really complain about that."}

Here you have offline starring, it saves your scrobbles and then asks if you want to sync them once you go back online. You can also fine-tune the amount of memory for cached songs. Finally what I most appreciate is the persistent notification with play/pause, next and previous. You also have them on the lock screen which was really missing.  And it's frequently updated! Definitely worth it!"}

I previously used Audiogalaxy, a free app that worked great but sadly, is no longer supported.  I had hoped DSub would be at least as good (after all it costs money) but sadly found it frequently does not recognize audio files with FLAC or .shn extensions. Overall, DSub would be a disappointing product for $1.99; and an absolute rip off for failing to advise \"customers\" of the 30 day limitation.  I'm amazed that the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement allows Floss to list this app on their site without providing full disclosure concerning the limitation of the service."}

Next/Prev track work great with those two apps.  Unfortunately, none of this works properly with DSub or the official Subsonic app.  When I hit next/prev track it stops playing.  I have to hit play to make it play the next track.  I find the DSub/Subsonic interfaces much more intuitive and easier to use than Google Play Music app so this is extremely disappointing.   I'm basically stuck using dsub/subsonic apps to download music to my phone and using different apps to actually play back the music.    Otherwise this is a great alternative to the stock app.  So if you don't care about bluetooth then I do highly recommend this.  ***EDIT*** Beta is available that makes bluetooth work PERFECTLY in my car.   5 stars for when that beta is released to the play store.

One thing I've noticed is that the creator really works his butt off to resolve known issues as well as introduce requested features from the userbase. (As opposed to the main subsonic app, which seems to be focused only on UI prettiness)  This app deserves 5 stars for the amazing dev support alone. Definitely seems like an even better buy now that the core Subsonic app requires an additional $5+ payment to remove advertisements."}

Well this app seems to be nothing more than a copy of the official that has been tweaked in minor ways, few of which  good. I was really expecting something different, but all they seemed to do was change the look of the menu bar and move a few buttons around. Then comes the biggest annoyance, it won't stop play back when it disconnects from Bluetooth. This instantly makes this app useless to me. Beware BT users."}
