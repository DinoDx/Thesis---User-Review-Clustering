And also my last suggestion, when retyping a URL that youve previously searched, with the suggestions popping up make them just 1 long text box instead of a huge cube. these isues arent really that big, just thought id give my 2 cents to help improve the app so you can 1 day be at the top of the play store!"}

Then I stumbled acorss Lightning in Tablified Market,  and man,  so pleased I did. Yes,  at this stage its a bit more basic than others,  but its truly fast, nice Ui, very small size (200kb) and supports Flash superbly! And the developer responds to emails and fixes problems super quick. Still needs some improvements, like being able to edit the names of bookmarks,  but overall it really is the best browser available for Android. Give it a try,  doubt you will be disappointed."}

I needed to have access to a specific site that requires flash.  I was fine until I made the mistake of upgrading to JB.  I went through all kinds of hoops trying to get flash to work.  I managed to get it working for lots of sites but never for the one place I really needed it to work.  I was pretty much thinking I was going to have risk unlocking & rooting my device to get back to ICS.  I thought I would try 1 more browser claiming to support flash.  It works flawlessly.  No problems so far.  I haven't noticed any big improvement in speed, but it is definitely  not any slower than any others.  Great App, keep up the good work."}
