I wanted an app to connect to my Ampache server via HTTPS and this worked.  Bandwidth limitation to help save some data usage on mobile is a huge plus!  It has a much better interface than then any other free Subsonic apps, and above and beyond any native Ampache apps (mostly all dead anyway).  Still, it is not without its limitations.  The audio focus is way off.  Not only does it mute the music when navigation kicks in, but it mutes the navigation audio as well.  Kind of useless at this point.  Gapless playback is not available (the first attempt to play streaming ogg files will just stop and skip to the next song after 20 seconds; would have to skip back to play correctly...just got annoying after a while).  It's a good app for those that don't really expect or need too much.  But, it lacks quite a bit that Ultrasonic (also free...but dead project) does better (list by album title, gapless playback, correct audio focus, and being able to list my video catalog and play them).  Since the Ultrasonic project looks like it's dead, I'm really hoping this one will catch up."}

It would be nice to say don't start play back until 1mb or 1 minute of playback is available. There may be protocol limitations that prevent this feature, but if not that's one for my stocking this Christmas :)"}

I love the server product (purchased long ago), and the mobile app has always been great.  However, since I upgraded my phone (T-Mobile Galaxy S4 - M919) to Kit Kat the app has been unusable for me.  It works for a few tracks and then spontaneously reboots my phone.  This happens when using wifi or mobile data connections.  I've cleaned all of my settings, did fresh installs, factory reset my phone, formatted my SD card (although Subsonic is using the internal storage), etc., and I still get the reboots.  I see that others are having this problem as well.  I'd really like to find some information about how to resolve this.  I rely on my Subsonic server heavily for music.  This will be a 5-star review when I can get this resolved."}

Now they've changed the phone app to be ALSO ad-supported? I understand the need to make money, and had this been the case all along it would be fine... but changing it and requiring people who've already paid for the support to have to then pay more to remove the ads? Ridiculous. At least give those of us who've paid in YEARS ago to keep the project going a credit so we can get rid of the ads ourselves or *something*. No contact at all from the developer about this is further disappointing. Honestly, thinking of switching completely to Google Play or Spotify as a result - then I won't need to have my PC on at home all the time..."}

Library can get out of sync with server and display the wrong artist's albums (I tap artist A, see artist B's albums) 3. Audio often stutters and stalls at the beginning of tracks, even on tracks that have already downloaded completely. This is the most annoying, because I have to switch to the app (often while driving) to restart the track.

I guess it's ok be cause ads don't really affect the functionality of the app and it's not a breach of contract. Now... the app itself is buggy just like the server is. I just had to, without a good reason, again uninstall the server because the 503 error about Jetty server came back. It's a long documented problem that has no solution other than uninstall server and install it back (installing over doesn't work). Now that there is no flash player available on Jelly Bean streaming videos is gone. Since this is where Android devices are going it would be nice if there was a replacement functionality. Other than that the updated app FCs on me all the time. So I'm being asked to pay for facelift I actually don't like, FCs and lack of decent video streaming. After all using flash for that is a hack, not a legitimate functionality. On the phone video controls in flash player are not meant to be used with fingers. It's a lot better to dump videos into Dropbox and stream."}

I installed the new version (having previously paid for the app rights like the others) and I am not seeing any ads at all.  I'll keep an eye on things, and update if something changes, but for right now I'm having no problems.    As for the update, I like it pretty well.  Navigation is much easier, cleaner and smoother in my opinion and the whole app just feels snappier.  While I like the transparency of the widget, I have to admit I liked the previous version's widget a little better.  Mainly, I would like to see the larger album art back for the widget.    Overall, a nice upgrade.  I'll admit, however, my review would be less glowing if I were being forced to pay again for ad removal, as others seem to be."}

It just crawls, and retries, and crawls, and retries... until finally it gets it.  It's so annoying when I want to load up my big mix and it takes nearly five minutes to get it going.  The only other negative for me is the horrific widget style.  I back up the apk, edit the graphics in the package, repack, sign, copy to phone and install.  It's a process but it's worth it not to have my main screen all jacked looking.  *** Update 10/18/2012*** Ads?!?  Are you kidding me?  Nearly all users have already dropped a decent amount of money on the server but now we're all asked to fork over nearly $4.50 for the app?  The whole draw was free app, test out the free trial of the server, than buy the server portion if you like.  Now everyone who paid for it has to put up with ads or fork over more money.  On top of that we still can't get a non-Flash (HTML 5) player.  My Kindle Fire is running Jellybean and I still can't stream movies.  Fix this!!!"}

I was looking for something that would allow me wireless access to ALL my music and video content without having to go through an online music storage site.   I just don't see the point of having to upload your music when you can play it from its current location.  Apple owners should love the fact that a one time payment gets them online access to all their music without being confined to Apple's walled garden, as I believe Apple charges an annual fee for ICloud music access.  Port forwarding issues caused a slight delay since I had some initial trouble accessing my music beyond my home wireless network, but I quickly realized I was using the internal IP address instead of the external one.   I did setup a different port number than the default and since I already have a web address through my WHS I just have to add the port address at the end of my WHS address to get access to the Subsonic login.  I've loaded this app on both my phone and tablet and have enjoyed the freedom from ads for two weeks now.  I don't use apps like Pandora, etc. simply because I have gigs of new and old music I know I'll like."}
