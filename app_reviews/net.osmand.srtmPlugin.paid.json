This increases even more the memory use on your phone: 1) the extra plugin, 2) again all your charts have to be downloaded but now as contour lines instead of the regular vectorial maps that you may have already downloaded. It works but the installation process is not presented properly in advance and its use requests do download a lot more stuff.  Osmand produces nice apps but together with all these extra adds on, more and more downloads, the size in my phone as reached almost 2GB by now. I guess is what we get by using off line features..."}

Now press the Settings button (cog wheel) in the top right corner 3. Select Manage Map Tiles 4. Select All Downloads 5. The top of the screen has a pull down list labelled with Regular Maps. Change this to Contour Lines 6. Select the contours to download.  Go back into the downloads and select Hill shade Cover from the pull down list to download hill shade In OSMAND, you can use the menu button to switch between cycling and walking modes and assign different layers to each mode.

But contour lines only come in at zoom level 13.  That's too close for me.  Also contour lines need to be thicker. Can we have controls for both contour thickness and zoom level?  LATER- Have found contour zoom controls in a strange place (the settings in OSMAND  badly need rationalizing) and 11 is probably ok. But still need a setting for contour thickness and/or colour."}
