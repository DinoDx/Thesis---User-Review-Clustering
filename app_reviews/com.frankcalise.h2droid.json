First off I can chose my daily goal of how much I want to drink in a day. What would be nice to see is a way to calculate the amount of water need to reach you goal which at the moment you have to put in manually. I can customize the units to show Imperial (oz) or Metric (ml).  Very easy to use, I have a choice of setting the sizes of my favourite cup, bottle or glass, so I do not need to put the amounts in manually, if I do want to manually add an amount or a historical entry there is a button on the main screen which also allows me to do that if needed. A very good app, with features that tells me when my last drink was and how much I need to drink to hit my goal for that given day. The only down side is the history, which I don't really care about, it would enhance the app if you did a monthly/yearly total or in my case a way to delete all old entries as I can see no value once the week/month has been completed . No advertisements, easy to use right from the start."}
