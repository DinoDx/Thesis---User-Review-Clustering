You can also tell it to blacklist specific SSIDs so it won't learn when you're connected to them - it will just ignore them and you can turn Wi-Fi on or off manually near them.  The easiest is probably the quick settings, however."}

Although, in practice, I am constantly battling it to get WiFi to stay on, even in \"learned\" areas.

I also noticed that since I'm battling the manager, I use more battery from screen time and WiFi being turned on and off."}
