It worked every time I tried it (about 15-20 times spanning a few seconds to several minutes). The tablet ON/OFF button (to force it ON/OFF) worked all but once where it wouldn't go back on so I had to start from a fresh boot. I really like the auto-ON/OFF function and hopefully the ON/OFF power button straightens itself out. Kudos to the Developer in providing so many options and a clean interface! Haven't determined if I am saving battery yet but will monitor it in the next several days."}

I feel so strongly about this being such a solid application that I just had to make writing a review a top priority.  .  I use this application on my Samsung Galaxy Music Player 5.0 and it simply works.  I like that it has regular settings and expert settings toggling.  I have not had any issue with the app at all.  I can't believe that the developer is giving it away free of charge.  I would say that this Application has doubled my battery life on the Samsung product since the app's real value comes when the device is idle and the screen is off as it does not use any wifi during that period unless it is plugged in or the user set the device to use wifi when the screen is off.  I am so impressed by the app that I have now installed it on my HP Touchpad which is also running Android ICS.    The only thing that I would changes is the ability to have a setting to have the device wake up at specified intervals say 30, 45 minutes for push notifications perhaps.  I also noticed that when Streaming Spotify with the screen off the music will stop even though there is at least 1KB of data acitivity which can be set in user threshold preferences.    Simply A++++++"}
