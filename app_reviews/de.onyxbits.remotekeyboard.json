I love the no-lag connection when using my PC keyboard to type in WhatsApp and the stock SMS app. The one drawback is navigation functionality, which could use some work... For example, I can use CTRL+Q to back out of a WhatsApp conversation, and then I can use up/down arrows to move around my current conversations, but there is no way to actually enter into a different conversation!  With my stock SMS app, on the other hand, I can select a conversation from my list of current conversations and enter into any one with my keyboard ENTER key; i can then back out of that conversation using CTRL+Q, but at that point I'm completely frozen! Up/down doesn't work anymore, CTRL+Q doesn't work anymore...so I'm forced to pick up the phone again. Still the best remote keyboard app I've ever seen, though (: (I think step-by-step installation instructions would be helpful to those who have no experience using a telnet connection, by the way.)"}

Anw, if I may give some personal advice or something that I want more for this application, which is I can select a conversation for example with my \"Enter\" in my laptop so I don't have to touch a conversation in the gadget. I think it will be a good thing (for me). But I very very like this application. So love it, thank you so much for creating this :D"}
