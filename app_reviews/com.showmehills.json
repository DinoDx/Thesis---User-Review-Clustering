The FOV calibration should make it more clear that there is a red band on the border. Didn't notice it first. In addition once you've tapped, the text should update (to say that the second part of the calibration is going on), to let the user know that the tap was registered. Unfortunately, it seems my phone doesn't have enough RAM for the app to run smoothly so I couldn't test it further. Nevertheless the idea seems good and it's open source  so I give 3 stars :-)"}
