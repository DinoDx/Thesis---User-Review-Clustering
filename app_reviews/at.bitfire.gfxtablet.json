Once I did get it working however, it works superbly. Even better than my wacom intuos in fact. For other people struggling; I did the following to get it working on Xubuntu.  1. Run a terminal window from the folder named 'driver-uinput' then type 'make' and hit enter to compile the binary.  2. In the same terminal window type 'sudo ./networktablet' and hit enter. Confirm any password and the gfxTablet client should begin running.  3. To find your network host ID for the android app, open another terminal, type '/sbin/ifconfig eth0' and hit enter. Your network host ID is the one called 'inet addr'. Enter this in the app settings. In response to the developers snarky comments about 1 star reviews. Instead of being so defensive, perhaps taking heed of the reasons people are leaving those reviews and doing something about it might make people more inclined to donate to or pay you for your work e.g. making the install instructions a little more accessible to the average user."}

This app saved me the trouble of having to go out and buy an expensive Wacom tablet. Basically, it's worth the download.   I've only had it for a day, but I made a few observations. First of all, the cursor gets glitchy when moving the cursor near the screen's edges. However, this is a very minor detail, since most of the movements are done in the center of the screen anyways. I'm just nitpicking at this point.  The fact that it only works with Linux bothered me at first, but eventually I just decided to do some research and set my computer (Windows 7) up to multi-boot with Linux. Learning how to set up the app in the terminal was a bit confusing, but I got it eventually.   The only thing keeping this app from having five stars is the fact that the majority of people want something they can download and use right away - partitioning, multi-booting, compiling, etc. can seem daunting to the inexperienced user, like me.  Overall, four stars for making me spend a whole day's worth of research just to install this app :p though it was a very rewarding experience. I'm glad I found this."}

Using Nexus7, so no pressure sensitive pen, but the app \"fakes it\" nicely by measuring contact area. So applying more finger area, or harder pressure with a rubber stylus (squishing the tip so there's more contact area) results in Gimp reading higher pressure. Experiment with pen Dynamics settings in Gimp to get different results.  Takes some getting used to, since there's no visual feedback on the tablet. Pen placement is thus an art in itself.  Would be mindblowing if future versions included some form of visual feedback on the tablet screen too. 4 stars for what it can do now - will edit later when the app matures with features."}
