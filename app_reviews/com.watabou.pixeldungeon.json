I realize that this may not seem like a big deal to some, but there is a huge lack of playable female characters in the gaming world and to see this game contribute to the problem saddens me."}

The reason for this is because most players who finish the game on earlier versions do so with heavily upgraded items.

Doing so would still up the late-game challenge without any effects on the early-game, which is difficult enough."}

It was addictive, intuitive and with practice, understanding the \"rules\" of the world, totally fun time-waster. I stopped playing though, when they added weapon and armor degradation. With the system that is used, that's unacceptable. It's balanced out by adding more weapons, but with limited inventory, such hoarding is rarely doable or practical. That almost kills it for me, so despite my better judgment, four stars for me. It's challenging, but if can deal with that aforementioned problem, Pixel Dungeon is great. My advice, on the other hand: go for Shattered Pixel Dungeon, instead; that awful degrade system has yet to be incorporated as of this writing, which makes the game almost perfect. Plus, balancing issues are smoothed out, and more content has been added. It's well worth the price of admission."}

The furthest I've gotten was to the 4th boss with warrior and still then i thought i was unstoppable. Anyways it's a very versatile, fun and addicting game.

You can one-hit monsters on the first level, but they can also dodge your attacks infinite times in a row (later on they can parry as well), this can get you killed at any stage in the game. Due to the poorly randomized level generator, 90% of your games leave you ill-prepared to deal with the level 5 boss; you will see the first four levels a LOT. But wait, there's more BS; non-optional nightmode, where if you play at night, the RNG is slanted even further in the enemy's favour (there is no reward for this increased risk). Despite all this, the interface is very nice, and the game is frustratingly addicting. However I would recommend \"Dweller\" or \"Infinite Dungeon\" instead, If you want a good roguelike. Edit: forgot to add, an update introduced item durability, so the 1in10 of those runs that are worth playing because you find a nice armor/weapon, you lose it shortly thereafter. Even those fans loyal to this game (who knows why) who gave been playing a long time think this is stupid, devs don't give a s**t though."}

I really think that you should add an auto save feature on every floor that you pass. Just an idea. I do think that the game is just a little bit too hard, seeing as the slimes are near-invincible, but impossible to put down."}

It has hip retro graphics, smooth game play, and scratches that *itch* that only a roguelike can.   Each game does tend to take a while, however, and that paired with the permanent death feature (you lose all your stuff when you die and have to start over) can be rather frustrating at times. I have been through levels 1-5 countless times and they've started to become monotonous, but it's nearly impossible to get any further because of the random difficulty spikes."}

I don't doubt that the game can still be played with this feature, the problem is it's not fun to play anymore and so I've completely stopped. I'm amazed that the dev has decided to stick to this enforcement even though he's alienating and losing a huge portion of his player/fanbase.  I know it's a free game (though I donated) but it just feels like a lack of respect for the insane amount of players who are saying \"please change it so I can enjoy the game again\"?

It is quite simple, yet challenging at the same time. A few different kinds of enemies, randomly generated dungeons, and a few things that will force you to take a chance. For example, you can jump inside chasms. You don't know what's at the bottom (or if there is a bottom) so you never know if you are falling to your death, or if you are falling into a pile of awesome and useful items. The starving systems a bit annoying. 8/10 for me."}

Now I feel that the balance between reward-punishment has been unfairly changed towards punishment for punishments sake.  The degradation of upgraded weapons, armour and items leads to some very uncomfortable game play changes which do not feel, like the rest of the game, fair.  Below is my pre-patch review.  How many dungeon delvers will this game consume?? Fantastic rouge-like that keeps you wanting to try again and again."}

It actually requires thought, unlike most mobile games. Also, even though it is inspired by other rougelikes, it is not a direct clone of another game with a different skin, unlike most other mobile games. Finally, it is HARD, wich gives it good replay value, because the developer has nothing to gain from making it easy (i.e. boring), since he published it to play for free, because he has your entertainment in mind, not your money."}

However, one suggestion I would make is different music over the variations of levels. I appreciate games like this good show!"}

Make more items, weapons and armor? like gold armor or armor with wings. more variety. Variety would make this game extremely interesting. And add more levels. Even after the demon levels. And more boss monsters. Dont make a pixel dungeon 2. just keep adding levels after the demon levels. And why doesnt the final item, that you get in the end. After the eye god. Why doesnt it give any abilities or powers? Just add more monsters. Scary monsters. Like god monsters. Theyll make the game more challenging and interesting.  and take out the degradation of armor and weapons please. Its not fun playing with weapons and armor that are completely stripped down to level 1. especially on the demon levels and monk and golem levels that are brutally hard. And when u have very few upgrade scrolls too. Just add more scary monsters that are super powerful and maybe a way to farm health potions."}

I read the tumblr blog on the rationale behind degrading items and put in a few runs to play around with it, I understand the reasoning and it's quite clever. Keep that +5 weapon for when it's needed (your boss killing weapon) and use that spare one for dispatching the rank and file scum. Most of us had a kneejerk reaction because we had developed goto strategies for runs and the new mechanic forces us to develop new ones... I hope some other players of PD read this and get what I'm saying... the game is better for it and it opens up countless new approaches to a run and puts us out of that comfort zone we developed which imo is important in a roguelike. Read the blog, do some runs, work with the feature not against it and it suddenly makes total sense."}

I have played a fair amount of Nethack, and can say Pixel Dungeon shares the same elements as classic roguelikes. This game is inspired by Brogue from what people are saying, and I definitely saw some similarities in Pixel Dungeon that I felt comfortable playing the game. Anyway, the pixel art style is basic but gets the point across. The music and sound effects are nice touches to keep players engaged. The controls are very simple compared to bigger roguelikes, but the gameplay has enough complexity while still remaining relatively approachable to new players. With a nice looking pixel art style, some good music and sounds, and a simple control scheme and gameplay that ends up as complex as the big classic roguelikes, Pixel Dungeon makes for an excellent roguelike game for both beginners and veterans of the genre."}

Even if you don't meet the STR requirement it will still provide damage mitigation. When the enemy is dead, take it off to remove the movement speed penalty. When you walk through a door you close it behind you, you can use this to your advantage against tough to hit enemies like wraiths by forcing them to eat a surprise attack (surprise attacks don't miss) when they follow you."}

I'm always starving to death while trying to level to face the first boss. I noticed that I can get no enemy's to drop food."}

It is so much fun! I used to have trouble with killing the first boss with a rogue or a wizard, but I found out that a rogue, in the end, is better than the warrior, for instance - I got my warrior to lvl 21 and down into the demon inhabited part of the dungeon before he died, and I got my rogue to lvl 26 and I killed the two hands/fists/bosses/gods whatever you call them! (although I did have two rings of evasion +8, but my thieves armor was never upgraded, and my weapon was a mace that had +6 and I had a hell of a lot of healing potions lol). I love the wizard, I also love the fact that I always find either a potion of strength or a scroll of upgrade or sometimes both on the first floor. the boss btw is easy to kill heres how - step 1 go into the doorway and plant either a fire or poison plant, step 2 do not move from doorway until you have caught the Goo's attention, step 3 walk away from the doorway and if you have time plant a second fire/poison plant in a one way hallway, step 4 take up your last stand in the puddle while the Goo is on the stone floor. Hope that helps you guys who are struggling"}

As someone who can really only play after sundown, I've found that it goes from pleasantly challenging to outright freaking obnoxious. Enough so that I just haven't been playing, and that makes me terribly sad, because I am so unabashedly addicted."}

I enjoy playing it and it's imho one of the best rpg playable on a phone.  It just leaves a few  things to be desired. Luckily I can play wazhack and nethack to fill that void..;)"}

Hands down the best Android game I've played. It's simple yet complex (play and you'll see what I mean). Playing this game and listening to music or podcasts has gotten me through a bunch of 4+ hour flight recently. This game just doesn't get old. The random level generation and item drops just makes it one of those, \"I'll just play one more.\" Kinda games. Surviving past your previous best play is SO satisfying. Tip: read up a little on potions and scrolls- it can be a little confusing at first but once you understand the game mechanics it is absolutely incredible. Have fun. A huge THANK YOU to the dev. Well done!"}

No two games will ever be the same. Another big plus: no ads and no crazy permissions. I've never had a cell phone game keep my attention for so long.

I like how the game keeps some things secret, (potions and scrolls), but it could really use a small tutorial.  And rats need a nerf.  Seriously, or give us more HP,  I've literally died on the first encounter with a rat.  Also, the game--thanks to its randomly generated sequence of maps--will often become impossible. (i.e. The black slime when you still have stock weapons and such.)  Food is really annoying as well!!!   ALWAYS hungry, more excited about a loaf of bread than I am an amazing sword, cause we all know we can't use any swords yet anyway.  (Speaking in context of the first 5 floors.)  I haven't even seen the shop yet.   Anyway, good game.  WAY to hard (at least for the beginning.)  Give the new players a break, don't kill them with one rat encounter."}

I found it frustrating at first but then discovered the wiki online which gives some valuable hints, like confirming that shops do exist - Believe me it's very difficult to stay the course on the way to level 5 when you wonder what the point of collecting the gold is. The levelling system is well balanced for casual players like myself and it does reward repeated plays with a little bit more progress each time."}

But be prepare to lose. This game is very unforgiving and mostly based on luck.

I don't recommend this game to anyone but those who like playing very hard games. It is frustrating but you feel awesome when you beat your best score. What I like the most about this game is it still updates with new shiny things pretty frequently. The reason I'm rating it 5 stars because it's the best rougelike game on the android."}

I can play it for hours. I do wish it was a little bit easier to get to the first boss, but I guess that's the nature of the game.

Wraiths are also too difficult to fight without a wand, which is hard to find also.  This is my favorite game ever."}

It does reward you for passing dungeon level 15 by allowing you to get a bonus to your class when you start over, so keep at it. In a way this game is very quick, but if you take a bit of strategy, you can play one run for hours. This game actually keeps me up at night, typically something that only happens on a hc console or pc. This simple, yet complex random dungeon rgp is just great. My gf even liked it and she hates me playing games."}

The hit chance is all f-ed up, some times you will hit almost every hit the hole game / other times you only hit 1 out of 10 tries for a hole game 6 games in a row.

Fast startup so it's a great game even if you only have a few minutes at a time. Tips: - use zoom for ranged weapons/wands - save food for sleeping/healing (hold \"wait\" button) in early depths - retreat back through doors for guaranteed hits (esp. wraiths) - fighting the ooze, stand at the edge of water (ooze heals in water) - buy potions of healing! - don't use arcane stylus - the glyphs are not generally beneficial - upgrade armor (save scrolls of upgrade for plate armor!) - save seeds of earthroot for the bosses - learn from each death!! So many deaths... Awesome game, watabou! And thanks for the source code - great insight into the mechanics!"}

Like any good roguelike, winning is an accomplishment unto itself. Adventurer death is permenant, and often unexpected. Since complete victory is so rare, there are in-game badges to celebrate the smaller moral victories of the game. And adventurers who make it to depth 11 unlock prestige subclasses, which remain available for subsequent adventurers and make surviving the early levels slightly easier.  It's a very simple roguelike, with only two or three character stats. Magic is stat agnostic and wands recharge with time. You only have a weapon slot and an armor slot, with an optional two rings. There's only around three  wandering monster types per dungeon section.  But there still is plenty of replayability, as you discover new room types, equipment combos, and subclasses. The maps are all generated randomly per adventurer, and equipment starts off unidentified and potentially harmful. When combined with the common theme and plot, it makes you eager to play through again so you can discover just a few more bits, and maybe this time... you'll win."}
