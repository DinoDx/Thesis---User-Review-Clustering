As the description states you can listen to something else and hear momentary beeps when you're supposed to change activity from walking to running and vice versa.   The screen displays instructions if you want to glance down and read them; the screen also shows a countdown timer for how many minutes are left in your workout.   I've not noticed any significant drain on battery when using the app, so it's clean, simple and straightforward.  It is free and doesn't ask you to buy add-ons, so it's just great. I am going to start over with week 1 of the training program after a less active time, so I decided to stop by and write my review."}

Beeps the same way every time to change the pace, so you have to remember where you are in the rotation for walking v. running.  I don't always remember, but hey--I'm out, I'm running, which is something I haven't done since college cross country, and since it prompts me, I'm less likely to find an excuse not to run.  Like other reviewers, I wish it would have a halfway point beep, and I'd love it if it would say \"run\" or \"walk\" (or alternate the type of beeping) instead of just beeping the same each time, but it's a truly simple app that works as advertised and that's good enough for me.  Tech support is great, too--I had a totally stupid question (wouldn't beep--darn media volume was off but I couldn't figure that out on my own) but the developer responded within an hour or so to my email and was very polite and helpful.  I have a Droid 4 and it works well with it.  Thanks for the app!"}

My only complaints are having to change my screen time out default to 30 minutes; also, if a phone call is received it automatically pauses training. Once the call is answered or ignored, you will have to resume the workout, even if your feet are still moving - this messes up the proper run/walk intervals.  Nonetheless, this is a great, free app to help a novice runner begin training to a 5k at a manageable pace."}

I've tried several of the other free C2k apps, and this is the only one I've found that has:  sufficient volume that I can hear notifications while it's in my pocket and has never had a problem with timing my jog correctly  On the issues side:  Although it doesn't have GPS, I use another program for distance tracking concurrently, which works for me.  I would like it if I could manage the volume for the app from within the app, but for some reason when I try to adjust volume within Simple C25k, it adjusts \"Ringer volume\" and not \"Media volume\", so I have to go to a different program. This may be my device (HTC Evo 3d).  The only real issue I have with Simple C25k is that I wish it went up to 10k! Otherwise it's really been the perfect app for me these past 7 weeks.
