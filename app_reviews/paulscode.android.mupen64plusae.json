MUPEN plays that game beautifully, but heaven help you if you try to step foot outside the Mushroom Kingdom!  Play WipeOut 64 and you'll notice half the graphics are missing.  Try Tom and Jerry: Fists of Furry and you won't get past the character select screen.  Fire up Sin and Punishment and your phone dies in a fiery crash after two minutes.  I haven't tried other games yet, but I expect more of the same, which seems to be the status quo for Nintendo 64 emulation.  MUPEN is worth the dollar for Super Mario 64 alone, but that's pretty much all you're going to get."}
