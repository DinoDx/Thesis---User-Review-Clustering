I wanted to use it as a data collector for the desktop master file, without sync issues and without carrying financial data with me. The intent was to export and then wipe all transactions. Export only offers two file format options, one of which does not support double entry accounting, leaving me with QIF. Export seems OK and the transactions are deleted as desired, but importing the QIF into the desktop software reveals problems. The Note field is not included in the QIF, the date format is apparently too ambiguous sometimes and prompts for a fix that is not always usable (breaks the import), and the import sequence is a long and too-interactive wizard. I thought I might use this anyway but have found it really doesn't add anything. For someone who wants to use the Android app as their sole financial tool, this might be an OK solution, although the UI needs a lot of work. For me... well, I'm going to uninstall it."}

I'm not sure I'm doing this right, but when I enter a new transaction and mark it as a credit, I expect to see a corresponding debit in another account. Instead, I see a corresponding credit.    Specifically, I entered a $100 income credit and expected to see a $100 asset debit, but got a $100 asset credit instead. If I try to change the asset credit into a debit, the income credit automatically changes from to a debit as well. Am I doing something wrong? The desktop app behaves as I expected. It's just this Android app that behaves strangely.  I have double-entry accounting enabled and I imported my accounts from the desktop app's XML file.  Reply: That's my problem actually. I want them both to be positive, but instead one is negative."}

Fully appreciate the fact it is quite early for the app. One thing I noticed is that changing of currency does not work - dollar remains there despite of the setting. Another annoyance is that by default when entering the amounts it enters values beyond decimal point rather than full amounts. Thanks.  Edit: 2012-12-05  OK, got currency to work OK - it might have come with one of latest updates - thanks. Still annoyed with having to enter extra zeroes each time at each amount entered. Anyone else has that?   BTW, export works beautifully and with the feature to enter default email address it is seamless. The import into GnuCash needs few clicks to create matching transactions depending from which assets they are funded from.  Keep up the good work! Adding one star more to the review. Edit 2013-12021. QIF export and then import to Desktop Gnucash works Great"}
