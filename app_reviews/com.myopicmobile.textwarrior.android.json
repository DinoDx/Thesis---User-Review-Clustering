It has performed flawlessly on all of them.  With the Android virtual keyboard it is easy to check spelling. It works fine with a hard keyboard.  To access options and settings press the three vertical dots on the bottom of the display.  Text Warrior is the best editor for large text files. If you are using another editor you will want to add this editor anyway and keep your other editor.    It should be remembered that this app is for text files. It is NOT a word processor.   If you are writing HTML text it will work, it just won't highlight. Hopefully  the developer will add HTML highlighting. When saving a file the first time you are in complete control of the filename extension but you must remember to supply the extention. Letting you supply the extention makes it possible to edit and create all sorts of programming files. These are usually text files.With Android 4.2.2 the Google Keyboard backspace key does not work properly. One solution is to uninstall updates to Google Keyboard. The other is a third party keyboard. For large Tablets use Hacker's keyboard. For phones and small tablets use Smart Keyboard."}

It works really well on a Xoom tablet. The syntax highlighting feature worked well for Python code. The application provides several different innovative methods for navigating through the text. I really enjoy using the trackpad technique. Selection of text is a lot easier using this app as compared to the native method provided by Android. Feature request: increase/decrease indentation of selected text and SL4A support."}
