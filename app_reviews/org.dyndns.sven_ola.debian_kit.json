To fix root:  You can actually change the root password by going into commandbot  and typing: [Debian] su (enter) passwd root (enter), and then it will prompt you to setup a new password for root. this should work, it worked for me.

Usability is the level of consideration towards the user, the average user that is and not a specialist. The problem is it's lack of documentation. And if there is some guide it jumps from layman to expert level hence and back that makes you wonder who the developer is really addressing. There's no way to learn anything from it, absolutely nothing. Despite the number of times I suggested a more didactic way of documenting this app the developer seems to ignore it. At least from here...Google Play.  If you follow EXACTLY what's on the video clip you may get lucky but once something stops the show you'd better email the developer. Meanwhile get your finger ready above the video pause since things go VERY FAST.  And once you succeeded and exited and want to re-enter and play with debian again the next day YOU'RE STUCK because there's absolutely nothing to help you re-enter the debian orbit. So it's an app for a (pretentious) elite. Sad."}

If you download the kernel sources for your system from Asus support web page and get running kernel configuration from /proc/config.gz , you can compile modules for your android. The RAM size could pose the problem, compilation may consume more memory than available, and the compiler will be force closed. I used swap file created inside /sdcard.
