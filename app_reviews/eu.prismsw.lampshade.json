There should be an option to prevent saved pages from automatically disappearing from their list once they have been read. 3. The search bar doesn't automatically initiate a search upon hitting Enter. Also, I'm slightly confused as to whether the saved pages are actually saved to phone storage, i.e. if they are available for offline reading. Gotta try that one out. But overall, great job.
