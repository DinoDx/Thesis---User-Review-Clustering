Any hacker or thief could track your home location(s) from your phone if you previously didn't disable wifi. If you forget to disable your wifi, or you just don't want to turn it off because you want wifi apps to work when you are in range automatically, then this app is for you. If you are into privacy and security as I am, then this app is for you.
