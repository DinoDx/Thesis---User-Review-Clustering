The notifications for upcoming sessions I've starred can be turned off or changed in the settings, and I appreciated the links to a map of the session location for each session so I can find my way there quickly.  The only improvement I can think of is to make it easier to find the next sessions as the  conference goes on; right now when I go to the list of sessions I starred, or a list of all the sessions in a specific track, it lists them chronologically and as the conference goes on, I have to check the current time and scroll to the appropriate place in the list.  I would love it if it jumped past or greyed out the sessions that are over so that I can more easily identify current & future sessions.  Thank you Christophe!"}

I updated the app so that a session in progress is now shown with a contrasted background color behind the time column. Also, when you navigate up from a session to its parent track, it will automatically scroll to the session you were viewing. Also note that you can hide past sessions in the bookmarks list."}
