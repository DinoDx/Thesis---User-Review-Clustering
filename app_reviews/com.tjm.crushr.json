If you, like me, don't want much more than a little place to jot down your tasks for the day, you should definitely give this a shot. The only \"complaint\" I have is that there aren't any options to change the widget's appearance, but even then, it's not like I really care much. It might bother someone that's more fussed about things matching."}

Just what I was looking for. It could use some work on the input by allowing SAVE to perform an implicit ADD, and management of editing items by allowing one to mark COMPLETE (with a swipe?) that could grey/strike-through; so you could reference it for a time until you really delete it. Just some thoughts, nice clean app though Ted, thanks."}

The title is pointless. No way to edit tasks. Too easy to delete a task - short tap means delete, and it's a widget that's always on the screen!
