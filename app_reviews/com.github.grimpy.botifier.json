But a little too great. Causes Pandora to remain in a \"dimmed\" audio level, and if you have any ongoing notifications, ex: Signal Check Pro, or Sensorly, that's all you will see on the HU. And if you have the TTS option turned on in the app, all you hear is what the ongoing notification is. So +1 to the App Blacklist; or, merge with CM10.2 ;-) ~Krylon360"}

The car radio normally only shows track name and play time even with Google Music and Pandora, so it may not be fully AVRCP compatible.  Update: the latest update works for me now, but a notification pauses whatever is playing, and it stays paused for as long as the message appears in the notification area."}

Works as advertised once you enable the notifier in your Security Settings.  My one issue is that the app turns your music down to give you the notification regardless of if Text to Speech is turned on our not, but when it does this it will not restore your music to the previous listening level until you dismiss the notification from your phone.  This completely eliminates what the app is trying to accomplish.  I hope the dev allows us to set a timer of maybe 10 seconds where the music volume will be reduced and the message displayed, then after that time the message will disappear and the volume will be restored to its previous level. Other than this tweak I think the app is excellent. Work great in my 2012 toyota Prius."}
