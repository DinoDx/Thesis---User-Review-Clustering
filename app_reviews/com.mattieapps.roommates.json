All I'd  like  is  the ability to split the cell phone bill among 3 parties, & not be forced to split evenly.  I want it as a recurring monthly expense,  not as a lending /borrowing arrangement.  Sounds simple enough.  But  it can't be found."}

This can be done manually using the \"Expenses\" tab and by creating 3 \"Mates\" and 3 expense objects. If you have anymore questions please contact support@mattieapps.com. Please rerate if this helps you. We hope you will give RoomMates another chance. Edit: A feature request has been created."}
