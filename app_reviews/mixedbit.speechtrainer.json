However, there are a few limitations.  If you use this where you have any sort of background noise, it does not work properly.  If you speak long sentences really slowly, it plays back the recording before the spoken sentence is complete.  Also, the app does not run in the background.  If you are able to find a quiet place and your goal is speech training for words or short phrases, this is a good choice.  However, in sub optimal environments, and depending on how you plan to do speech training, it might not be the right one.   I prefer EchoHacks Speech Trainer for longer sentence drills.   It is more resistant to background noise, and gives me control how many seconds I want to echo.  I am using both Speech Trainers for different purposes as they have different strength and weaknesses."}
