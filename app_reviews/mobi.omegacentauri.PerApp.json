There are some control issues however. The app has notifications to tell you when it's running that can be turned on, off, or only in use. That said I see an icon in my notification bar all the time. Even when the notifications should be turned off an icon sits there which I hate to see. The addition of a widget for easy on/off would also be incredibly helpful. Lastly whenever i make changes to app controls, particularly volume boost, I have to reboot my phone before I see them take effect which is a little frustrating.   This app covers the role of individual app setting that android should do by default and does and ok job."}

It's already been said, but a must have feature is for full volume control, not just boosting. I would be able to use this app almost to my content as it does have many other useful and unique features, but it doesn't have a complete app list. Ala, things like Google and Samsung TTS, other 'hidden' programs.  If we had a more comprehensive list, then I think this app would be usable if not necessary for all power users regardless of a few missing features."}

Problem solved! I just disable cpu and all other functions except volume control, set default at 12, then set some individual apps to 1!
