If you can make this application detect whether the user is actively using the device or not, and if they are using it, then there isn't any point to send the notification. Because they are seeing the notification themselves on the device. For example if you can make an option in the configuration page of the application, something like: \"Send notifications only when the device is locked.\" and the application detects that the phone is locked (not in use physically) it should send the notification, otherwise not. That too could be an 'option' of course for those who'd like to opt for it. The reason I am saying this could be useful is because in my Ubuntu setup, I keep a record of all the notifications like android. So all of the notifications that I received when I was away are stacked. Now, when I am away from my computer, I am probably using my phone. So when i come back, at times i have up to 50 or 60 notifications which all of them I have read on the phone.  Do you think this is possible?"}
