Recent version replaces the spinner with a flashing bar that demands way too much attention, and doesn't show new entries, instead adding a button at the top. That button entirely misses the point of not showing it all immediately, as it shoves everything down at an unpredictable time, causing taps to miss. The market thing still needs an option to install older versions. Update that supposedly follows some UI guidelines made the top bar blue, and caused the article list to lie to me. I read three articles, returned to the list, saw the same three marked unread, tapped one - and got an entirely different article.
