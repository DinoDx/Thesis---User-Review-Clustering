The only motivation to play is to gather treasures in each land, so the gameplay becomes rather repetitive quickly.

UI is very poor (modal, unreasonable scrolling limits, etc), and the controls need more tweaking. Overall, interesting for a short while, but ultimately uninstallable."}

Like its alright and pretty easy to catch on to but its downright boring.  The world looks cool, the view and the way you move are pretty cool. Theres just so little to do.  Like you run around grabbing little stars and tricking monsters into moving within one hex of you so you can click and destroy them.  Um if there was a combat system and you could get items it would be pretty darned sweet.  As it is I wouldnt call it a roguelike...Its more like a puzzler.  Not that a puzzler is so horrible, I just was expecting more.  Thanks"}
