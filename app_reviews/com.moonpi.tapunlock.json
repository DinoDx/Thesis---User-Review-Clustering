And usability is much better as well. I was surprised to see it work so well on my device, after reading it's still in beta.  There are some features I'd like to see in this app additionally: - A setting to show user-defined text (owner info) on the lock screen; - Show next alarm time, similar to stock lock screens; - Maybe a feature to bypass the lock screen if the phone is connected to one of specific WiFi access points.  Good thing, the app is open source, so maybe I'll implement some of these features myself and will send a patch to the author for consideration."}

But I still have some issues with it. It seems to lock everytime my screen times out (I had my phone set up to only lock after 30 minutes unless I locked it manually). A minor thing I can live with though. Of more concern is the fact it still won't work with an encrypted phone - at least it won't replace the encryption challenge. While the NFC key may be fairly secure, a 4 digit pin isn't very secure. Would prefer to use a strong password at least for backup access when NFC tag is unavailable, especially since I have to decrypt my phone now. Also would be nice if notification screen didn't constantly display app as active. It's just burning notification real-estate"}

Works well without having the root access on device (really thanks for that). But, the NFC tag unlock screen blocks the useful lock screen features. It'd be better to see the lock screen with time/date/weather widget and lock screen apps/notifications, like it's seen on pin access screen. Also, live wallpaper is not supported on NFC tag unlock screen as it's on pin access screen. Few issues noted so far, 1) some time when the device is restarted it asks to set the default launcher again. 2)  if try to launch an app directly from lock screen (pin access lock screen) it asks for the pin twice."}

The Bad: Sometimes the NFC connection sound is heard but the screen is not unlocked, therefore you need to look at the phone when you unlock it to make sure it actually unlocks. I have had bad experience with that when you need quick access and you end up scanning four times before it actually unlocks. Usually I end up using the \"PIN access\" button but it needs to shut down the screen and back up going through this nice cathodic tube animation before I can actually input my PIN. This is the single most annoying thing for this app and made me deactivate it. I would love to have the PIN input straight on the first window.  Overall, the concept of the app is brilliant, I would love to use it again but as of now, it seems to be a little unreliable."}
