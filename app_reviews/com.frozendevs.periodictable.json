I'm just assuming it is.  Here's my reaction to the program.  Pros:   Simple, clean, easy to use user interface.   Much information provided.   No ads.   No permissions required.   No distracting eye candy.   Small memory footprint.   Open source - presumably spyware free.  Cons:   It has crashed on me, but nothing bad happens if it does.  It just restarts.  Hopefully, someone will find the bug.  Suggestions:   It would be nice to have links to a definition of each chemical data type (\"sublimation point\", \"triple point\", \"heat of vaporization\", etc.)   \"Unknown\" is reported when there is no data.  It would be nice to divide that into true unknowns (i.e., yet to be discovered), \"not applicable for this element\", and maybe \"does not exist for this element.\" - Or maybe those last two are the same."}
