Elegant color choices. Clean animations. No fancy/jarring effects on tap/select. Keyboard is perfect. Black background on dial pad is perfect. Way better than those lameass Bhatia black themes that you have to pay for. Even better than the paid for Less Ugly themes. The right blend of gray, black and blue."}

All I ever needed with these themes is a dark messaging app but I have to trade off usability elsewhere to get that. Your theme on the other hand is highly functional and designed in good taste! Thanks."}

The holo dark and blue color palette is present in the entire system UI. There is no white on white shading, like many indecent themes. You've done a spectacular job. All I ask is that you theme the status bar, all of the quick settings tiles (like the battery one) and all of the Google apps, as well. The theme will be perfect that way."}
