Sure it did some uploading. I can't disable the sync notification, which would only be of interest in case of a problem.  However, the OC interface brought my server to a crawl. It was really slow to show some message threads, some of them with names, some with only numbers. And it took literally minutes to switch among them when I clicked on them. Also, it only shows the last (?) message of each thread, and the number of messages. Even that with wrong date.   And it didn't accomplish why I purchased and installed it in the first place: didn't sync messages among devices. Which, while the description only states to sync to the server, would be quite logical, considering the whole point of ownCloud is to keep stuff in sync among multiple devices/computers.   So in the end, I'd ask for a refund if I could. At least until it's fixed to an usable level."}
