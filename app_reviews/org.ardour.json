Just find out the ip address of your usb interface using ifconfig. Pop that address into the program and boom up came the track list and i was able to use it as transport control.  Oh dont forget to enable OSC control and feedback in ardour."}

Move away from your home studio desk, and control the tracking session with your phone or tablet.  I was thinking of buying a small control surface so I wasn't tied to the computer keyboard and mouse while laying down a track, but this does the job almost perfectly.  More features might be nice, but it does the things that really should not have to be done with a mouse and keyboard, so I'm giving it 5 stars.  ------- In Ardour, go into Edit->Preferences and open the 'User Interaction' tab.  In the \"Control Surfaces' section, click the 'enable' and 'feedback' check boxes for the OSC section.  Now run the Ardroid app on your Android device, then go to menu->configure  and enter the IP address of the computer running Ardour, then go back to the main screen and click 'Menu->'Connect' and you now have a nice remote control device that will allow you to arm your tracks, play, record, rewind, mute trace, solo tracks, etc.  Much more convenient than trying to control Ardour with a keyboard and mouse while balancing an instrument near a microphone."}

Transport works flawlessly on Ardour 2 too, though track information isn't available"}
