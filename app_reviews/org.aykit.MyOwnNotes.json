Good Luck. - Needs work.", "comment": "The ability to use self signed certs without install like in Owncloud would be great, having to set the CA Flag in the cert is proving next to impossible in PFSense which makes all my certs, and is even controlling my webserver which is totally legit, and the signed request came through perfectly. So why you and other Owncloud based plugins for Android cannot work is beyond me. I know following the best practices is good, but unless your going to teach me how to make a Certificate that is self signed, and is accepted by android, you need to make it work with normal self signed certs.  Also, you stopped replying to me in E-mails so I am updating this."}
