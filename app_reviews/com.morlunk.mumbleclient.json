It runs very smoothly and the UI is phenomenal . My only problem is that I can't hear anyone lol. I'm currently using it on my Droid X2. It's definitely not a hardware issue, but more likely something to do with the actual mumble server that I use. Apparently it's running 1.2.4, I've tried disabling Opus support but there has yet to be any significant effect. Help would be greatly appreciated! Please forgive my ignorance, as it is probably something very silly."}

Most of the apps I've tried before Plumble fall short of what the desktop client can provide.  Plumble is the only Mumble client on Android that supports OPUS.  OPUS supports on the fly audio bit rates while having higher fidelity than traditional Speex and CELT codecs.  This is pretty important for mobile users because they do not have access to a reliable connection at the best of times, and therefore a much better experience not only for mobile users but other users in the chat lobby.  A mumble server will force all users in a chat lobby to default to Speex if a client in the lobby isn't OPUS compatible so this feature to me is critical in addition to the bandwidth savings.  The UI is GREAT!  Its very clean and organized, with the ability to swipe between chat and lobby views.  The ability to enable a push to talk button and have it work anywhere outside of the app is great as well.  You can use any other app and still have access to the Push to Talk Button while you do so.  This app is superb!  10/10"}
