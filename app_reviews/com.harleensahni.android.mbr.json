Sometimes the songs that play are ones that I downloaded for my daughter and even she is embarrassed about them as well. This app lets you determine which apps should playback instead.  My suggestion is as follows, and I know this can be accomplished with Tasker but I feel this is way easier to use for Joe Schmo. Please allow the user to designate which app should launch. For example, I use Serius XM to listen to Howard Stern during my drive. It would be awesome if I could get Sirius XM app to launch via Media Button Router. Unfortunately, the Sirius XM app is not recognized as a media playback app so I cannot designate it in the Media Button Router UI. If you allow the user to designate which app they wish to launch, that would be a great advantage for people using apps that are also not recognized as media playback apps.  Again, great app. It is a must for anyone wanting full control on their phone."}

Select Google Play Now in the list, as well as S-Voice.  You need to say \"open app play music\" to run Google Play, as opposed to simply saying \"Play Music\" as a command.  Set Google as the default, and all works as expected.  The other headset buttons allow me to pause, next, previous just like the standard music player does.  Great little app, and I'd be happy to pay for this if it was not free.  5-stars, and many thanks to the developer!"}

This app is just what I need, except that it doesn't work for me.  I use Rhapsody almost exclusively.  I see it in the list of choices when I configure the app.  However, when the play command comes in from a bluetooth device, Rhapsody is never in the list of choices.  When I go back to the app, Rhapsody is then un-selected.  I am running this on a rooted HTC One.  I'll happily give the app 5 stars when/if it works."}

The built in stereo unit on my M37 would always play a podcast or music randomly when it finished automatically connecting via bluetooth. Very annoying when you have passengers or simply didn't want to resume a podcast while backing out of a parking space.  The only downside to this is now Google Play Music and my podcast app no longer respond to the wired remote from my headphones. I use my galaxy s3 in the car with bluetooth and wired when I'm cycling. I can no longer hit the button on the wired headset to pause/play music. For those interested, of course, the volume and forward/back/skip functionality still works fine. This app needs an option to only insert itself between the play/pause command after a bluetooth connect/disconnect status change. Then it'd be perfect!"}
