Pros:  - Can use alarm volume level even when phone is on silent or asleep. - Will repeat the alarm at intervals you select, so that if you miss it the first time you will eventually catch it again. - Can stop the SMS message from going to other apps such as the messaging app. This way it is only in the pager app and you don't have to clean it out of multiple lists.  Features that could be added to make it totally perfect: - Multiple triggers. My boss works in IT and is a member of two volunteer firefighter departments, so for him, having multiple triggers for multiple senders would be good. - A widget that could allow you to turn on call on and off, so that you don't have to go through the menu to do it. - Displaying the message even when the phone is locked and allowing confirmation, similar to how a phone call shows up and allows you to answer it even when the phone is locked.  These are minor things though... the feature set overall is excellent and does just what I need. I especially like the interval feature, much better than FireAlert's continuous duration feature."}
