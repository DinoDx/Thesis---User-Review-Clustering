There should be an interval setting where we can select say - 1 or 5 or 15 or 30 min warnings. If the user does not wish this to occur they can set the interval to 0  Rob PS Apologies if you have already provided this feature (and I have not found it yet)"}

When turning on wifi, it automatically generates a message before even checking to see if wifi is available. This can become a hassle. Very obnoxious where wifi is patchy. Remedy these issues, and it would be a 5 star app."}
