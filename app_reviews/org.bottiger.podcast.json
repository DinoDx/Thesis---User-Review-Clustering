Why does this app require so many invasive permissions? My phone number? The number I'm calling? My phone ID? WTF?"}

However, all the permissions, and why they are needed, are explained on the projects github page ( https://github.com/bottiger/SoundWaves/ ). The project is also open source so anyone with coding experience can verify the app **never** shares any data without your permission.\n\nMail me if you have further questions"}
