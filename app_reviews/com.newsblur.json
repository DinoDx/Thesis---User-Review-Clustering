But that is not the point. Newsblur  has more features than other news readers I have tried, and all are definitely geared towards folks who have lots of subscriptions and like to power through those feeds.   It does have most of the functionality and a more. I like the \"learning feature\" that allows you to mark an article, choose a tag or author you tend to always read. This brings those articles up front and center as it lists a total of those next to the total of unread.   I found Newsblur in the infamous Google reader shutdown. I liked the free version so much that I paid the developer for the \"plus features\". Have never regretted that. (no the app is still free, the subscription applies to your account)."}

Thank you thank you thank you!!!! Oldest to newest added!!! That's responsive!!!  ###First review: I must have sorting from old to new.  This new to old is unacceptable and simply won't do.  The 24 dollars I spent for a year's subscription will hopefully encourage the development of this app to include such ability.  Everything else about it rocks.  Very simple.  Happy to support this app and would even buy it, but stays at two stars, since I simply cannot use the mobile app.  Sorry, I am OCD about my RSS feed reading...###"}

The android app had a similar issue which was resolved before I could even write an e-mail about it.  So NewsBlur has had a bumpy start, but it's turned into a better RSS reader than reader ever was.  The creator is quick to fix problems, receptive to ideas for change, and just a nice guy.  I have no doubts that NewsBlur will just keep getting better."}

After trying (and not liking) Feedly, I wanted to find a well reviewed RSS hosting service that could replace Google Reader. Newsblur seems to be run by someone from his house. But he's doing a great job. The Android app could use some work. The folder sorting does not match the folder structure you use in the web version until after you install the app (so if you are a new user, get settled in the web version first before installing). I was a long time GReader Pro user, and I liked how quickly you could scroll through all unread messages and mark previous ones as read as you scrolled. This app almost forces you to view items by folder, and mark all as ready before proceeding to the next folder. I'm used to the new workflow. I hope performance gets better with each new release. A good start!"}

I'd also really love to see background syncing like greater, newsrob and others.  also the android client often seems to repeat news entries when you reach the end of the cached articles, it will start to replay the same 3-5 articles until it has cached new ones as if they were the next ones in the list. NewsBlur for android IS a pretty solid overall client to the web service, but it's not a good ui  if it were me, i'd toss the android version, then try to replicate the ios version on the android platform as faithfully as possible."}

The fonts and spacing are too wasteful for a phone screen.  I think the Google Reader App shows double amount of content without sacrificing any readability.  Your app should take a note from that.    In addition, the tags also wastes space.  I don't use them, but they can take three lines of precious screen space for some articles on my Nexus 4.  It's really bad that some articles use half of the screen for title + tags.  Please provide an option to disable that.  Finally, why can't I view already-read items in folders?  If I go to individual feeds, those items will be show in grey (assume I have \"all\" filter on).  But I get a \"loading stories...\" screen forever in \"all stories\" or any folder."}
