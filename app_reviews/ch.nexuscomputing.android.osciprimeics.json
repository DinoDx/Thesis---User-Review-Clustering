PLEASE NOTE: This only tested this products ability to monitor TTL logic signals from a serial interface. No other functional testing was done.  From: Andreas Rudolf Aug 6, 2013  Dear Mr Slaughter  I am writing to you because of your review for the Android Google Play Store application \"OsciPrime Oscilloscope\". Not long ago, Google has made it possible for developers to publicly reply to user reviews. However, I would rather not reply to this review publicly.  My suggestion is that you remove your comment. You can still keep the rating of course. However, it would be a nice thing to rethink your review. After all, it is technically not possible to measure TTL signals over an audio input line, and this is certainly not our fault, neither have we ever indicated or implied such a functionality.  We are sorry if there has been any confusion with the product, the OsciPrime software and hardware are both completely open source and we try to ke"}

While I'm sure some people would like more complex features & user interface gimmicks, I'm quite happy with the $5 US price and the fact that it runs on old Android hardware.   That gets it 5 stars right there.  I ran it on my old Samsung Galaxy Tab - I haven't found a worthwhile use for this device since I bought the darn thing, until now.   While it would be nice if all the dialogs fit on the screen (there are a LOT of options on some dialogs and it pushes the DONE button off the screen at times), the fact that I can scroll and still access everything keeps it functional.  I plan to use this to teach my kids sound theory along with a homemade Arduino sound synthesizer and an Access Virus TI."}
