Before few days it crashed and didn't start anymore. I reinstalled it and all records are gone. Now I have no idea how much hours to report at work. I'm in trouble now. I thought that automatic backup saving is \"must to have\" in such an  app.  In addition all time reports are in the same list, it's not so comfortable."}

Otherwise you could just login again and all of your time registrations should be back.\nI tested the upgrade schema extensively so I wonder what might have gone wrong in your case. You are the only one reporting a crash upon upgrading the app.."}
