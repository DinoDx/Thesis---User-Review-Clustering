I installed on my tablet and can't figure out how any of it works. I have the wikidpad for Windows and love using it. If it's only for phones then i'll retract my review but if it does work for tablets and someone can explain to me how to get started loading a word list I would appreciate it."}

Two areas for improvement that are important to me. Wiki words created here don't automatically add themselves into my desktop version when I sync with Dropbox, and there is no night theme. Other than those two things, this app is great for editing your wiki and makes it easy to get down your ideas on the go."}
