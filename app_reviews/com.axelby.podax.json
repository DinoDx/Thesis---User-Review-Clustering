Best replacement I've found for Google listen, but there are a few annoyances. The interface in the main app could be cleaner/more modern android, and I had occasional problems with podcasts pulling their image off other feeds.

If I have a podcast paused and I get a text it will start playing in my pocket for example.  But, the UI is great, it's simple to use, it's a great little app and its both ad free and free to download. I'd heartily recommend it."}

Looking for a basic replacement that just downloads over wifi and plays podcasts. Podax has 2 features I use that Listen didn't. It has controls on the lock screen to pause and play without having to unlock. It also has an automatic resume when connected to Bluetooth, so that it automatically resumes my podcasts when I get back in my car. I tried beyond pod and others but I like Podax's simple, well laid out interface.  It shown a few bugs since I have switched to CM10. On the notification screen it shows a stop button when nothing it playing so it is not possible to resume playing from the notification screen."}

I guess you can't complain too much when the app is free. There are some parts that need improving: the times are usually wrong, there's no way to arrange the queue except in release order or manual, you can't set how many previous pods to download per channel."}
