After your explanation I did some experiments. The hardware step sensor in my Note 4 records accurately if I am walking or running steadily for longer distances. However, working in a very busy restaurant, where I walk or run 7,000 to 12,000 steps a night with constant stops, kind of like a basketball player, is mostly not recorded by the hardware step sensor, so this app does not register them. This is not a fault of the app. If I were using this app to record steady walking or running as part of an exercise program it would work fine. This app is simply not for me and I'm raising from 2 to 4 stars."}

For the serious walkers, they are all going to be broken pretty quickly (I started 3 weeks ago but I am already on 12/19).  Can you add more unlock features? Fore example, \"15 days consecutively walked over target\" even up to 1 year. I know it's just numbers, but it's good to have them as fun targets to have.

To those who say they are having problems with missing counts make sure you have the persistent notification enabled in settings (4.4.2 requires this behavior to keep the Pedometer app from being killed). It doesn't place an icon in the notification bar but does place a step counter notification in the pull-down. If you're like me and like keeping the notifications pull-down clean you can hide the notification for this app by going to Settings>Apps>Pedometer> and uncheck \"Show notifications\", it SEEMS this gets rid of the notification w/o interfering with its purpose of keeping the app alive in the background all the time. Provided the persistent nature of the app doesn't result in any crazy battery drain I will be bumping my rating up to 5-stars."}
