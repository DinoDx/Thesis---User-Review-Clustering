Though, it will show the last call I made instead. Not sure if bug or working as intended. I think it is more useful to show only incoming calls, not outgoing ones.  Edit: The developer just replied to this review to explain why outgoing calls show up (so he/she can have a quick redial button). Seems to me he/she has given this more thought, and I\u2019m happy to rate this the full 5-stars!"}

Right now, it is by design to show the last call in the history, as I wanted a redial button on my lock screen."}
