The app, however, which IS a paid-for product is a disappointment.  When uploading a file over 3G it all too often fails part way through, then hangs forever at, say, 67%.  Or, it will know it has failed and when you click on the notification status it then just opens the ownCloud folder that your upload /would/ of gone to had it worked.  The annoyance is not simply having a \"Retry\" option to re-upload again without having to task kill the app and finding your file to upload.  Fix that and you're onto a winning app.  Two stars for the app, 10+ for the web back-end."}

It's crashed a few times, mostly the way 7, but I love it. It's a great way to get files between my desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone. It even plays music within the app without having to open a media player (not always a plus: it does only one song at a time). I wish it were easier to switch between accounts but it's not that bad. I like how it can back up my photos to my server without having to go through Google. Especially useful for work photos that I don't want to share with a third party."}

Not what I was looking for. Not interested in an app which needs so much configuration, too much configuration takes out the productivity. So as much as I would like to give this app a full house of stars because it's probably just awesome, I give it only 3 due to the info wasn't clear enough to me about how this app functions and then that it needs your own webhosting, which is probably great, but not that great for me. Perhaps others think it's great, but that doesn't apply to me. So, I'm sorry for my \"bad\" review and actually would like a refund although I think your app is awesome, just not awesome for me."}

One poor thing is that instant upload makes copy of all synced files to sdcard which causes that all synced files are stored twice.  G+ and Dropbox sync services are better in all these ways.

Works fine on an old T-Mobile SpringBoard (Huawei MediaPad) with Android ICS, but under the KitKat load on the Galaxy it keeps going 'Server took too long to respond' every time I try to connect.  I know this is a client issue because, as mentioned, the load on the SpringBoard works perfectly well. This also means the server side is OK with Apache as the web service end.  No, I'm NOT changing my entire web structure to Nginx just to accommodate what should not have to be accommodated! This is a client-side issue and needs to be fixed at that level.  Two stars only until this problem is dealt with."}

This is possible to some extend. I only want to upload videos when i am on wifi, so by instant video upload i checked this option. I would think that when i make a video out of range of a  wifi network this video would automatically upload when i connect to wifi network, unfortunately this is not the case.  This would not be a total problem when you could select a folder on your phone/tablet and checked to keep this in sync on wifi/mobile.  Plz add support  -To automatically upload instant pictures/video when you connect to a wifi network. -Option to keep folders in sync. So that i can keep backups of other apps."}

Using FolderSync for more complex syncing these days as the owncloud client definitely is _very_ bare-bone. At first, simply naming this \"owncloud\" is a bit misleading - it should possibly be \"owncloud file client\" as it is limited to handling WebDAV/files and ignores anything else owncloud has to offer - calendar? vcards? Plus, even in transferring files, the app leaves things to be improved: Making the storage folder configurable would be a start - I definitely would like to have this on external_SD in my device. Same, a real folder sync would help - this is basically impossible at the moment (if I manually create folders or files in the owncloud folder on the Android device, the app still doesn't see or transfer these). Maybe future versions will do better here."}

Need to add an option to only allow uploading while charging as well 5. Option upload videos as well 6. Thumbnails support for videos/pictures 7. Support for ownCloud docs 8.

This may be a good thing as it allows you to only sync the items you actually want on your phone, however it would be equally good to be able to say \"sync all\" and then unselect certain items. 2) No way to specify the location on your phone. This is a BIG problem for people whose main memory is more or less full but have an SD card available. 3) No way to specify the auto-upload location of photos. 4) No way to share files/folders with other users  While owncloud itself is great I struggle to be able to recommend this client in its current state as a paid-for app. Once fully-featured, I'd be more than happy to recommend it."}

It would be fantastic if the sync directory was on the sd card (ExtSdCard) instead. This way it wouldn't take up all the space available and slow the phone (device) down. I would say many users would prefer this. Also, please know that I looked into moving the app to the sd card but this phone (device; that being a Samsung Note 2 / Sprint / CDMA) has specific hardware constraints that will not allow this. So please consider adjusting the app to include the ability to do the above. Thank you for all your hard work and have a fantastic day!"}

It claims it can do instant photo uploads, but all it does is create an empty folder and then complain that the folder doesn't exist. You're still stuck with Ubuntu One for that task.  This app only works for file downloads/uploads and playing single songs (no playlist/album play/repeat/cover art). Since the ampache server stopped working with ownCloud 5, there are no other apps available to play your ownCloud music either, so you're stuck with keeping a Subsonic installation for that.  I'm giving it stars since I like the ownCloud _server_, it works great for calendar and contacts sync, but I'll be uninstalling this app until it gets useful."}

After taking a picture there is a toast popup that complains about not being online the first time instant upload is running, even though I have full 4G service and the \"wifi only\" option is disabled in the app.  Tried it w/ wifi on and it still failed.  Update:  Manually creating a folder named \"InstantUpload\" got rid of the warnings and the feature started working.  Looks like there is a bug in the code that creates the folder if it doesn't exist."}

I have a big tree of directories and files (for example, copied my complete dropbox in it), and even if I'm using a decent wifi connection, some files are synced, the others are not. There are folders (of which \"Work\" seems to be the most important one) which simply don't synchronize. I guess it is because the syncing process halts at some moment, but if you compare the speed with which Dropbox shows folder content and with which Owncloud shows folder content --> that's a huuuuuge difference.  In short, I think it's going well, but more frequent updates would definitely be nice as would a more complete GUI and smarter syncing be (give priority to a directory I'm viewing instead of syncing some other one I probably don't need for another week)."}
