First of all, it is not clear Bluetooth is used as the main screen only shows an 'Add wi-fi computer manually'.  When it runs, it sometimes does not react correctly to 'Start presentation'. LibreOffice on the notebook already shows the presentation, but the phone or tablet does not respond.  When landscape view is used, flipping through the slides in your deck is way too sensitive. including some simple back and forth buttons might also help, but first of all, tweak it down a little.  In the slides overview, especially on a smaller screen, a highlighted border is shown on the line below the slide you tapped (and is shown).  Besides this, it is a nice tool that I will certainly use more often. Thanks, keep it up guys! The only thing I could wish for now is a stable version of LibreOffice for Android ;-)"}

Favourite feature (in addition to 'everything') is the inclusion of the 'speaker notes' on my phone below the slide control. One change request: When using the one-slide-at-a-time mode, where you swipe left or right to move forward or back through slides, would be great if the sensitivity was adjusted - it can be overly sensitive at times meaning I have to very carefully pay attention to how I'm moving ahead one slide or risk skimming across several slides all at once. Of course, I have since learned to use the volume up/down for more precise control, but a more precise screen-swipe option would be ideal. The volume up/down can also be used to simulate a 'mouse-click' for appear-on-mouse-click animated elements. THANK YOU!"}

Could use bigger icons in the slide sorter view on the remote, or better yet, a forward/back buttons/arrows. the ability to jump is great, but i don't want (in my adrenaline mode of presenting) to over shoot my next slide, so an arrow for advance once would be good as well."}

Why should one pay 5000 Rs for presenter when you can even read notes in mobile whilst presenting??   Still many features need to be added. Some important I expect are 1. Exit or End Slide Show 2. Slide Sorting 3. Hide Slides 4. Lock Screen rotations in mobile ( Global setting over ride ) ( While in presentation orientation of mobile changes every now and then. So the screen. )  Any way Thanks to the developers."}

Overall, I love the application, well done. :)"}
