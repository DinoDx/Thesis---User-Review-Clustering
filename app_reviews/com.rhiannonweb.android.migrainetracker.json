First off to record the time you're supposed to click when the migraine starts and when it stops. Migraines can last for days!! And if you are like me it never fully goes away. It just gets worse, goes down to bearable, then shoots back up. You can't even record ANYTHING!  No triggers, no symptoms, no medications used, nothing useful. You may as well use a stopwatch because that's what this is. Uninstalling!!"}
