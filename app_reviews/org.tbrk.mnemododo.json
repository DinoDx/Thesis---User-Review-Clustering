I'm a huge fan of  Mnemosyne. I've been using it since 2011. It's user-friendly, and it helps me a lot with my studies.  Mr. Tim, I wonder if you could possibly make cards EDITABLE on the phone. It's easy to correct a mistake on the spot.  Once again, thank you very much for your wonderful app."}

Being able to review flashcards on the go means that you are no longer chained to the computer during daily review, can fill empty minutes of the day (waiting for the train, say) with reviewing, and improve learning by varying the environment (a key principle of learning is to practice in different environments). This elegant and simple app does just that. If you use flashcards (esp. for language learning), this is the best money you\u2019ll spend."}
