This app is a definite godsend and well worth donating to.  I did run into some weird problems with my S4 where when I put in a new SD card, this app completely failed to ever pull pictures from folders on the SD card (though it working when setting a specific picture rather than a folder). But when I told it to use the Donation version instead of the normal one, the problem went away. So many there was just some installation problem or something (since the donation version isn't supposed to be different from the free one). I don't know. But it's working again for me, and no other slideshow wallpaper that I've seen in the play store comes even close to this one. It gives you great control over what gets displayed where and how it gets displayed. I highly recommend it."}

As I am running Jelly Bean I downloaded the app. I used the FREE version and it worked fine and  was truly great.  So I paid for the app. The paid version will not work for me, no matter what I do or how I configure it.  It seems like this could be fixed, since it was working fine on the free version.  At the very least the description should be updated to say will not work on Galaxy S series running ICS *OR* Jelly Bean.    I'd rather they get it working though. When it was working it was great. The only improvement I'd recommend other than the Galaxy S problem is it should also should be updated to work with animated gifs.  Update: changed review from 1 to 3 stars.  I deleted all versions of the app and plug-ins off my phone, and reloaded the non-donation (FREE) version only and it seems to be working again, which is weird and confusing, but at least it works. Great app. Maybe the animated gif thing will come later.  ;-)"}

It's actually kind of fun having a different background on every page.  Never want your main page wallpaper to change?  The app can handle that.  You can pull backgrounds from multiple folders or just create a folder on your device with the pics you want displayed stored in it.  You can even use pictures you've stored online.
