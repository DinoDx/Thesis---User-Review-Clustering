There are a limited range of fractals and gradients. It doesn't appear to have the ability to create new or random gradients other than randomly selecting the preset gradients. With practice outstanding results can be achieved. It's very absorbing and time consuming. I haven't checked all of the features. The developer has not really considered what it's for or what it should be used for thus my main criticism is this - ROTATION please. My Great Wave Off Kanagua cannot be rotated. My fairy tale Christmas snow scene is crooked! Fractals are good for generating backgrounds - like Sky, or Snow, or Sea. The result has to look like a stylisation (and that's a big word for me) of something that does exist. Natural fractal forms recreated with Frex. Push it further. Then make a pro version and sell it."}
