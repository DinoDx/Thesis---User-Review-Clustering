There are a couple bugs still, but not enough to make me give up on the app now, though.

Then I edit the event on my phone, re-entering the correct date/time (which are showing correctly in the editing box, just not after the edits are submitted) and I'll end up with the event showing on my phone & the website at two different, but equally bizarre and incorrect, times.
