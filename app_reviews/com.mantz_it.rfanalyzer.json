Nexus 10 Acer A500  Haven't tested my GNex yet or my S4, but I strongly suspect they're going to work too.  If you want high performance, use the HackRF device.  The RTL-SDR device works well for what it is, but for $5-15 dollars on eBay, it's hardly got the scope and ability of HackRF.  This is a FOSS project.  Like the author says, you can get it for free on the website and sideload.  What do you get for the $1.01 you pay here on Play?  Simple.  Ease of loading the program and you put a bit in the tip jar.  I did...I'm not regretting it."}
