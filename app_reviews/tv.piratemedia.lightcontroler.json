But it has a lot of rough edges; brightness is crazy, when I slide up it increases, at the top it decreases again and sliding down decreases 10% or so and then leaves the lights at 90% brightness. The disco mode cannot be turned off, you need to kill the app to turn this mode off. When I only use 2 zones, I always have 2 times 4 zones in the app, the maximum. Color temp for white zones does not stick, can slide but it jumps back to 0. And the sideways sliding is alsof sliding the pages, I'm fighting this interface. Also had to restart my wifi box, it kinda lost it's way. And I had to kill the native app before using this one. Can't use the app as it is until I'll organize an extremely bright disco party :):) I'm dying to use this without the bugs and I am willing to pay a few bucks for it."}
