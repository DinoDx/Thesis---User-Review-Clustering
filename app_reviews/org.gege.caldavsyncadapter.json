I did a little research on how to configure this and it works perfectly. Now I can update the calendar from any device, IOS or Android, and all other devices that connect to iCloud are in sync.  12/3/2013 - Not sure what has happened but I went to set an appointment today on my iPhone and it will not get through to my Samsung Note tablet. I do see the event in the iCloud calendar and it goes to the other IOS devices just fine. The only resolve is to delete the Caldav account and recreate it. Once I do that it will sync everything in the iCloud calendar to the tablet but the same problem occurs if I try to create a new event in my iPhone. I am running v 1.8.1. I will check if another release is available but I have to downgrade this rating to 3 stars until some progress is made."}
