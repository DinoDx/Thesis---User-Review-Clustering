But, of course, this only works on the PC and I'd like to have an app to access what I created. The sync works, but the app doesn't support the assigned categories, which I need for sorting and filtering. Unfortunately, it only supports filtering based on predefined criteria like progress, priority, and start and due date, which is not enough for a big pile of TODOs. I hope that this is added in the future."}

In the recent past, so could Symbian. Fast forward to the marvel of modern computing - Android - only to find that the best Google offers for tasks is a shortcut to their mobile site (and they're NOT a system-supported concept in any way), while it pretends never to have heard of notes / memos at all (clue: they're not the same thing as full-blown Google Docs). And woe betide you if you want synchronizable tasks that are not Google- (or some other \"cloud\" server-) based.  Enter this small app that pledges to fix that - it adds task handling to the already existing CardDav / CalDav sync adapters that let you keep your contact and calendar data on your own server, offering a way to sync without having to rely on anybody else's \"cloud\". For privacy-conscious people like me, this app is simply an absolute, indispensable, must-have tool. Well done!"}
