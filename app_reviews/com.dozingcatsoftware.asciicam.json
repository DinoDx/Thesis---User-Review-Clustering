It takes the live camera feed and converts it to ascii characters in real time.   It has 3 color modes and allows you to choose any combination of characters. Works great, just as described. so you'll be able to create some incredible text art, even if your not technically inclined to do so. Create a self portrait of yourself drawn using only lettes & numbers or one of your car, or just whatever you point your camera at.   Some potential changes to make this a perfect 5 star app, IMHO Allow the characters to be changed, one at a time, in real time as the image is being displayed. Include more character combination presets & descriptions of which characters work well together for each mode.  I would also like the option to apply the setting to all 3 color modes at once as I had difficulty copy/pasting in the text fields for some reason.   Thank you developer for putting in the hard work to create & release this app while keeping it open and free! Also, please consider adding this to the F-droid repository."}
