The problem is that this app doesn't seem to work well when it's not running in the foreground. Often I found that while it's resting on the dashboard mount that's out in the open for all satellites to reach it, I'd go to the app and see it's waiting for gps signal... and waiting.. and waiting.. Ended up uninstalling until it. I'll try again if I seen it gets updated. T-mobile HTC One, 4.3"}

It's possible your phone isn't in a location where it can get a good GPS fix. One workaround you can try is to let your phone sit on your dashboard until GPS locks on, then you can chuck it in a car compartment. That said, I'll see if there's anything I can do about speeding up a GPS lock in the app."}
