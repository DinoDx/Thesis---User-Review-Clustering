Once the app is open you just need to tap on the plus sign and select \"new note\" to start writing. Can you clarify your workflow for me, so that i can improve the design of the app?"}

The project was kindly transfered to me from the original author. You can read his statement here http://tinyurl.com/ntnckf4 - The quality of the codebase has barely changed (if not improved) since the transfer.\nhttp://writeily.me/"}
