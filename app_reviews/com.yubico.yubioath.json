Yes, Google authenticator does store your secrets on the phone. I have backed up, restored and viewed the database on my rooted phone. So a hacker can just as easily steal your oath secret database and install it on another phone. Scarry huh? Luckily with this app once set up properly your cryptographic secrets are stored on your yubikey! You need to \"flash\" your yubikey with the yubioath \"applet\" otherwise this won't work."}
