This app takes all the best qualities of Astrid and improves upon them. My only problem is that the font color of the list items in the transparent widget is grey. Due to this, it appears very washed out in both dark screens and light screens. If you guys could make it white, it would vastly improve the readability."}

Thank you very much for this! I would like to suggest an improvement for the notifications: usually I don't need a notification right when the task is due, but some time before that, like 15 minutes. It would be great when one would not have to enter the date and time for an additional alarm to be notified before the due time, but simply by choosing how many minutes before the due time. Thanks"}

Not a tag that will remind you when you're near the location, but simply a location tag as the Google Calendar have, that allows you to set the location where the task will be performed. In example:  List of restaurants to check: - Restaurant A - Restaurant B  If there was a location attribute I could easily put the restaurants address and manage to navigate to my GPS Application. I made an example with Restaurants to check, but it's also useful with a large number of to do's. With this improvement it would be 5 stars to me, nevertheless is an amazing application."}

If I set a reminder on a task on my phone, the task appears on my tablet with the due date but no reminder. * The categories appear to be internal to Tasks, not to Google Tasks. When I sync'ed my tasks from Google, I could see the categories in the left-hand menu, but there doesn't appear to be a way to change them or add new tasks to the existing categories. * Recurring tasks (as has been noted) don't sync across devices. GTasks can do this; what's keeping Tasks from doing the same thing? * I realize Tasks is open-source and free, so I expect a little less \"polish\" than paid apps, but the old Android v2 settings menu is kind of jarring. I applaud Tasks and hope to see more improvements as time goes on, but right now GTasks is slightly superior."}

I have a brain injury and Astrid was the only tool I ever found (other tthan the long gone ECCO Pro) that could help me see things in a way that I could plan and get things done .  My life was devastated when it was discontinued, and I literally could not function.  I have a feature request that I know would help me a lot, and would probably be useful to others as well.   I used to color code the lists (green for financial, red for medical, etc) and these color tags would appear next to each task. This was a big help to me in visualizing the big picture.  It would help even more if the task names themselves were color coded in some way, perhaps by the color of the first list they were entered on. I cannot tell you how valuable this would be to me  Thanks so much for the excellent job you have done. Please keep,up the good work!"}

You have created a huge accomplishment by building a very respectable task app. For my purposes it's ideal, I happen to be one of the few that do not wish to share my thoughts and life with the world, i.e. the various clouds and online storages. It's a stand alone app that shares its info with my a-Calendar+, the only possible info theft is from Google itself, as they feel the need to have access to everyone's personal data. Whenever you offer a paid version, I'll buy it."}

The only think that needs work is the widget:  I'd like to be able add a little space between tasks, as it is a little clustered as of now. Checking off tasks in the widget would also be a very welcome addition and one I feel is lacking right now. Overall it's a great app, but there is room for improvement.
