I was looking for something like this for hours, and was thinking of writing something small myself - but this is much better!! the fact that the logging is so detailed is helping identify not only heavy usage apps, but also apps that keep your phone awake for naught.  It would be great to have CPU, wakelock usage etc. I know there are other apps that do that well - but it will be great to have everything in the same place, so I can actually compare CPU peaks, network peaks etc. over time.  This is a 5 star for sure."}

Though I consider it a 5 star app (honestly, more like 4.5 stars), there are some things I would like to see added.  Most importantly I think, is better unit display with the apps list. I don't want to see that an app has used \"16244572 bytes\", it should automatically update to display in KB, MB, or GB, depending on how large the number is. At least put commas in the number so I can more quickly judge the order of magnitude.  Similarly, the graphs are very nice, but the axis labels should be rounded to more convenient numbers. I appreciate the graphs adjusting them so the data fills the whole thing, but instead of making the labels at increments of 126.3 KB, which is unintuitive to read, it should display at 100 KB, or 150 KB, or something like that. Same thing for the times at the bottom; with the size of the graph and the amount of data on it, giving me readouts to milliseconds is completely meaningless. Instead, make the labels appear at whole-number hours, which again would be much more intuitive.  Finally, I would love to be able to export the data, either to a spreadsheet, or even a pdf of the graph for to see on larger screen."}
