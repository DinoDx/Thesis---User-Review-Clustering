Wanted this app for a while.", "comment": "A nice feature would be if I could upload other files such as audio recordings. Good way to monetize this app is to offer a backup service of the images for BTC in case the phone gets lost, etc.  They already have their wallet out, would be easy to charge like $0.10 per backup."}

You can already do other file-types - though it is not as obvious and easy as with pictures. You can just share any file with this app - e.g. an audio file and do it this way."}
