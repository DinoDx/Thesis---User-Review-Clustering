If you have the same problem, first try the method for samsung galaxy devices in cyanogen mod page if that doesn't work, like it didn't for me, search for samsung usb drivers as a .rar package, go to your device manager or Win 8>Update Driver>Manually select the folder and update most (or as many as possible) drivers of unknown devices, samsung devices, serial gadgets, etc..Then try the cyanogen mod for samsung galaxy devices again, this time it should work and the installer will work too :)  Overall, very good installer, a very good refresh for those using your stock samsung os. Brings a lot of awesome Android features that I didn't know of (For e.g.: the calculator has matrices!) Kudos cyanogenmod!!"}

It was either  a case of waiting for the fix, or trying out CyanogenMod again (ran it on both a HTC Hero, and an SGS 2). After seeing this new installer, I gave it a go. Didn't work first time, but after reading that the choice of usb port on the PC made a difference (using a laptop), I tried again, and worked perfectly. Looking forward to trying out CyanogenMod again."}

I use a nexus s and i've flashed a lot of roms previously and this app was made to do those things easier i guess but things are getting complicated.!!  What's d point of wasting a lot of time with no use at all.!! In the meantime I would have installed a new Cyanogenmod rom in the usual process.!!! I never thought trusting this would cost me a lot of time.! When I came here to write a review, I realised am not the only facing this problem.!!  Hope you come up with a new update fixing all these problems.! Looking forward.!!  I rated it 2 stars only because you people at least came up with this idea of making things easier. Otherwise only 1 star since I never got benefited with this, instead lost so much of time.!!"}

I installed this as a quick and easy way to use Cyanogenmod, and it is easy, it's a great way to install it. However it's not without it's faults, and I'll explain them below.  10.2 had issues with System Update, as it would stop/crash constantly.  It unlocks the bootloader, which is awesome, and installs clockworkmod recovery, and installs the latest stable cyanogenmod. While this is geared towards Novices, it leaves them with no way to restore their previous stock roms easily, leaving me with a broken install of cyanogenmod.  I had to learn how to use fastboot to load a factory image I downloaded from Google's website, and then was able to restore it that way, not noobie friendly in the slightest.  So if you don't know what you're doing, do NOT use this, because you will get screwed over if it doesn't work properly. However it's a good learning experience, on how to restore stock Android..."}

And there it was:  Cyanogenmod. Of course, you'll have to figure out how to load in all of the Google Apps on your own, as these aren't supported (and thanks for the lack of head's up, Cyanogenmod).  Cyanogenmod really made me appreciate how slick the HTC One's original interface was, and how well everything actually worked. Unfortunately, it was super easy to ruin that and seems monstrously difficult to go back the other direction and restore to stock HTC One. I have a Sprint HTC One, and it seems pretty much impossible to go back to stock. You see, the phone isn't rooted and you still have to unlock the bootloader. After that, you have to root it and do all kinds of stuff that is over my head.  It's a waste. It was great the way it was, and I thought CM would enhance it. Nope--quite the opposite. It removes features and turns it into a mess."}

As support is all but non-existent, if I didn't know how to unlock and root by the convention methods, I would probably wait until I was confident enough to do it that way. If you do decide to use this method, make sure you totally understand what you're getting into. Your options after using this method are rather restricted.  Update. This thing just gets worse! Using this system, I'm unable to install TWRP recovery, thus greatly reducing my options. I tried upgrading to CWM Touch and it won't respond. I checked the Cyanogen Mod forum and lo and behold, they refuse to offer any advice on restoring to stock. They suggest you use Google to find help. This is just pretty sleazy as far as I'm concerned. I would in no way recommend this app."}

Then slowly I came to notice a bit more lag than usual on this device. The real deal breaker tho is the app YouTube becomes extremely pixelated and I've been trying to find a fix to no avail. Its a great rom but these are the reasons ppl love OEM updates. Just annoyed -_-"}

I was happy to download this and got started installing pretty quickly.  First hangup was that Windows 7 does not have and could not find drivers for my Google (Samsung) Galaxy Nexus so the Windows side of the installer could not find the phone.  I hit up Samsung's website and downloaded the drivers for SCH-I515 (I think) which got me rolling.  During the install there was some sort of hiccup but the on-computer screen directions got me back on track.  Good stuff!"}

If I uncheck debug and re-enable (as I don't know what else to do) the process fails and installer states \"Device Unsupported\". Still will give 4 stars on the idea, knowing they'll probably fix it soon. (I hope!)"}

I have a Galaxy S4 on the sprint the network.  I happen to love the phone but I hated most of the bloatware that it came with.  Your ROM Installer was just the thing for a semi novice such as my self.  The only thing that is really bothering me at the moment is that the contacts wont sync profile pic with FB or LinkedIn.  Syncing with Google works just fine however.  The data on the google and linkedin accounts seem to be merged without a problem.  Facebook data and profile pics don't seem to want to play nice with the phone sync at all.  Other than that the only things that I have notice so far was it hanging up during reboot and the camera app taking a while to load."}

I dl the CyanogenMod Installer to the phone , then it directed me to dl the CMInstaller on my pc. I put the phone in debug mode + launched CMInstaller  + plugged my phone via USB. The program put my phone in download mode, I saw the blue robot..etc. It went through the process, then it rebooted my phone. However, when the phone booted back up, it went into my regular home screen of Android  4.0.4. All that happen to my phone was that it wiped the data on my phone. So, what am I missing here?"}

I followed all the steps and when I reached the \"Installing OS\" portion of the install, it just took a crap. Said it couldnt communicate with the device. I had a mini heart attack thinking it was bricked but I looked up how to do it the old fashioned way and it worked no problem. If you are interested in installing cyanogenmod I highly advise do some reading and do it the proper way and not this sideloader half assed crap and save yourself frustration and an hour of wasted time. Oh and dont forget to install \"gapps\" when your done. ;)"}
