Needed something that I could easily keep score in various games and customize  the values so that it was quick and easy to use and get rid of paper & pen.  This app did that, and it had what it needed to do it well.  Things like keeping the screen on, and also being smart enough that if I hit +500 +100 +100 that I was saying +700 for that person for a turn.  Works perfectly.  Now my only 3 things I would love to see to make this app even better.  1.) When exporting to PDF find a way to export all that same information that you can see in the game history like in the app.  Then you can make nice tables/graphs in excel with the data and see the nice time/score layouts.  2.) The 4 on screen buttons are by far the most important for me playing games with high point values.  I was able to work with just 4 but it would be nice if you could customize to add a few more if desired.  3.) I have not made a mistake YET but I know I will especially with drinking games.  If I hit +500 points to somebody and meant to hit +100 I wish there was either an \"undo\" button or there was a \"inverse\" button.  Meaning do the opposite of a buttons value to fix mistakes."}
