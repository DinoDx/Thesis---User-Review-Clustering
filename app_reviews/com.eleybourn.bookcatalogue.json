I've already added over 80 books with many, many more to go.  A couple of issues, though.    1.  There are too many steps to check off that you have read a book - select the book, select the edit icon, select notes, select that you've read it, then select save.  Given that marking a book as read is a common occurrence,  it seems like marking a  book as read would be easier.    2.  When I try to scan Barcode/ISBNs, sometimes it tells me that the ISBN is invalid, but when I enter the ISBN manually, the book is found.    Beyond those two issues, though, I like the software and am looking forward to finally getting my library cataloged."}

Easy to use with excellent help tips for first users. Far too many features and functions to list them all, but adding, sorting, customisation are extensive, well designed and easy to use. Love the fact I won't lose data painstakingly entered, as I can sync with Goodreads, export to csv, and back up to SD card. Only issues I've faced so far are related to Goodreads, not this app! :) Anyone who's a keen reader or who has a book collection they want to catalogue will love Book Catalogue. And I'm sure you'll also think, like I do, that it's well worth making a donation to support the developers!! They can't earn anything through Google Play for their wonderful work, because they're Australian."}

I collect manga, and where searching by title and author is well and good, many sales go on based upon the publisher. The app has that data available whenever I add a new book, but I can't organize my list by it.  Just a suggestion, it would make it easier to know which series I need to finish when there's a sale going on.  Love the app, no more buying multiple copies for me!"}

One thing I would mention, once you put a book to one bookshelf, I don't think that there is an easy way of moving it to an other bookshelf in the app like scanning it on another bookshelf. It supports a few scanner apps, from which google googles is the best, but I'd be happier if i-nigma was supported as it's very fast, or if I could add books by importing the ISBNs. Also it's a shame only barcodes can be scanned and not ISBN numbers. (some books don't have a bar code)."}

My previous library app made you click through again, and it was very frustrating when you just wanted to zip through a stack of books.  I'm curious if the developers have any intention to add a \"backup to dropbox\" option. I think that would take an outstanding app to a whole new level of awesome!"}

You can go back and add the shelf then find the book, reopen it, and edit which shelves it is on, but that's a hassle.

The interface is easy to use and much friendlier than some other apps out there. I love that I have the option to sync with Goodreads if I wanted to (I don't, but I like that it's there). And I love that after it scans and saves a book, it defaults back to the barcode scanner so I don't have to re-select that option. It saves so much time.

I wasn't interested in creating an account on some service or becoming part of a social reading network; I just wanted to input information about what books I owned so that I could keep it at my fingertips while traveling. That's what this app allows me to do with ease! Modern books can be barcode-scanned with the phone camera for immediate data retrieval from various online sources, filling in most of the important information fields for you. You can edit them as you wish or add notes before saving. Thumbnails of the book covers are also imported this way, but again, you can change them if you wish. Older books without barcodes can be put through this information retrieval system by typing in their ISBN number. And for even older books, which have no ISBN, you can input all the information manually. Once the info is there, it can be organized and displayed in a number of ways, including user-defined bookshelves and listings by author, title, genre, format, etc. My only criticism of this marvelous app is the rather unattractive icon -- a minor quibble."}

As a goodreads user, I have this list of books already, but the goodreads app is nonfunctional without internet, and therefor much less reliable than an app which stores the information on the phone itself.  I was initially unable to get goodreads to authorized my account, and was faced with a disappointment.  I emailed the developers and got a quick response from the incredibly helpful development team and was able to solve this issue by changing web browsers (the default browser was crashing when attempting to authorize).  Now I can sync the app with goodreads and quickly use the app to check my 'owned' shelf before I buy books, even in areas with limited or nonexistent cell service, a lifesaver.  I very rarely comment on apps, but the sheer usefulness of the app, paired with the incredible helpfulness of the development team, makes it impossible for me not to share."}

With my fixed focus camera, I can't use UPC scanning, so I downloaded Google Goggles as the app recommended. Goggles scans the book perfectly fine, except that there is no way to get the info found back to the app to add the book to my list! One of the most important steps is missing, as I have a big collection and no time/energy/desire to sit around and manually input every UPC (although I may begin doing it since I have no other choice). And the problem was listed almost a year ago on the developer's site, with no answers and, obviously, no change. Will update my rating if/when this gets fixed.   Plus one star for getting me to try Google Goggles. That is one amazing app!  UPDATE: Dev finally got in touch with me. Turns out the Goggles doesn't allow you to add book from info (bug with Goggles, apparently.) It's much faster to enter manually by ISBN anyway, so I added a star. Doesn't do everything I want (such as read bookshelf from genre - so you enter it manually, or show missing books in a series), it is a bit confusing (such as listing book styles), but has been a huge help already."}

The app treats commas as a separator, and you will soon have a very messed up bookshelf list!  Use the apostrophe instead (\"Library - Left Bookcase\").  The author might want to fix that.  Well done Evan!"}

Really like the sort options and adding newer books is a snap.  Also really appreciate that this app has a \"is this book singed\" flag.    However - I have a LOT of older books and there are a few things that would be very helpful for entering books old manually  Allow an option to prepend a zero to manual entries.  Add a button or option to switch to manual entry when books fail to validate the ISBN - and an option to switch back to scan mode without having to go back to \"add a book\"  Automaticially populate the cover price field on an ISBN lookup    I would consider these minor usability tweaks    A great feature request would be to allow this app to access my kindle account and import my list of kindle books.    Best library app I have used on android. Bookbag for blackberry has a superior lookup function - but it runs on PC and you can only search your library on the phone.  Book catalog is far better when only the device capability is considered."}

I did have a couple of books that came up wth more than 1 option for the name of the series (both of them language variances) but all I needed to do was pick the one I wanted. It also has an easy way to see which I have read or not as well as being able to make my own comments about the book.

I have scanned Manga, Sci-Fi, Cookbooks, & many others & this app has found every single book in the database. There is one slight thing that bugs me is that when trying to save what bookshelf it is to go to & it's location it will not save the information at the same time. You have to chose your bookshelf & when you save it you are sent back to your booklist. At that point you have to go back into the book & set the location & save it. If you choose your shelf then go to location, set the location of the book & save it under the location page  the bookshelf designation is lost. If everything could be saved at one time that would make it perfect."}
