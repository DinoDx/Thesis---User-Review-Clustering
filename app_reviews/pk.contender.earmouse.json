This app has been pretty usefull in helping me get a better feel for chords and progressions while showing me exactly where the gaps are that I needed to fill.  It starts off pretty easy but covers all of the areas you would do well to get familiar with. Music is fun when you know enough to play along but it's a lot more fun when you really know what's going on!"}
